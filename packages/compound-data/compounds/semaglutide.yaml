  - Rybelsus
  - semaglutide injection
  - GLP-1 agonist
category: FAT_LOSS
subcategory: GLP1_agonist
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
clinicalPhase: "Approved"
description: |
  Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for type 2 diabetes (Ozempic, 0.5–2mg
  weekly SC; Rybelsus, 7–14mg oral daily) and chronic weight management (Wegovy, up to
  2.4mg weekly SC). In the STEP trials, semaglutide 2.4mg produced ~15% average weight
  loss vs. 2.4% placebo over 68 weeks. Cardiovascular outcomes trials (SUSTAIN-6) show
  significant MACE reduction. Robust evidence base across type 2 diabetes, obesity, MASH,
  and cardiovascular risk reduction. One of the most impactful drugs of the 2020s.

halfLife: "~7 days (injection); ~1 week"
onset: "Appetite suppression within days; full weight loss effect over months"
duration: "Ongoing; effects reverse within ~8 weeks of discontinuation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - oral
mechanismShort: "GLP-1 receptor agonist: delays gastric emptying, suppresses appetite via hypothalamic signaling, stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion"

dosing:
  min: 0.25
  typical: 1
  max: 2.4
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once weekly (injection); once daily (oral Rybelsus)"
  notes: "Titrate slowly: 0.25mg/week x4, then 0.5mg, then 1mg, then 1.7mg, then 2.4mg (Wegovy protocol). Inject abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Oral form requires fasted administration with ≤4oz water."

sideEffects:
  - name: nausea
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Most common side effect, especially during titration; typically improves after 4–8 weeks"
  - name: vomiting
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Particularly during dose escalation; eat smaller meals, avoid high-fat foods"
  - name: diarrhea
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "GI motility changes; typically resolves with time"
  - name: constipation
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "From delayed gastric emptying; increase fiber and fluid intake"
  - name: pancreatitis
    severity: severe
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Discontinue immediately with severe abdominal pain. Contraindicated with history of pancreatitis."
  - name: thyroid_C_cell_tumors
    severity: severe
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Observed in rodent studies; contraindicated with personal/family history of MTC or MEN2. Black box warning."
  - name: muscle_loss
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Rapid weight loss can include significant lean mass loss; resistance training and high protein intake are essential"

interactions:
  - target: tirzepatide
    type: antagonistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Not combined — both are injectable weight loss agents acting on overlapping pathways. Tirzepatide is generally more effective."
