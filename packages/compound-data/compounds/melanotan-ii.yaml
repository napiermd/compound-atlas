# Melanotan II — Melanocortin agonist; tanning, libido, fat loss
slug: melanotan-ii
name: Melanotan II

description: |
  Melanotan II is a cyclic heptapeptide analogue of alpha-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone)
  with potent agonism at MC1R (tanning), MC3R/MC4R (libido, appetite suppression, fat loss).
  It produces significant skin tanning without UV exposure, erection/arousal enhancement
  (bremelanotide/PT-141 was derived from it specifically for this effect), and appetite
  suppression. The original Melanotan I targeted only MC1R; Melanotan II is non-selective
  and hits all melanocortin receptors — producing a broader profile with more side effects.
  No FDA approval; RESEARCH ONLY status. Widely used in tanning and sexual enhancement
  communities. PT-141 (bremelanotide) is FDA-approved for female sexual dysfunction and
  derived from MT-II.

halfLife: "~0.5-1 hour"
onset: "Libido/arousal: 30-120 min; tanning: builds over multiple doses/1-2 weeks"
duration: "Tanning effects persist for weeks post-cycle; acute libido effects 6-12 hours"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous_injection
  - intranasal
mechanismShort: "Non-selective melanocortin receptor agonist (MC1-4R); MC1R drives melanogenesis; MC3R/MC4R drive libido, appetite suppression, and pro-erectile pathways in hypothalamus"

dosing:
  min: 0.25
  typical: 0.5
  max: 1
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily or every other day during loading; 2-3x/week maintenance"
  notes: "Start at 0.25mg to assess tolerance (nausea is common initially). Inject SC in evening due to flushing/nausea. Loading: daily for 1-2 weeks. Maintenance: 2-3x/week. Use UV exposure to develop tan once melanogenesis is primed."

sideEffects:
  - name: nausea
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most common side effect, especially initially; fades over first few doses. Start low (0.25mg)."
  - name: flushing
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Facial flushing within 30-60 min of injection; usually resolves within hours"
  - name: spontaneous_erections
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Involuntary erections in men, especially at higher doses; can be embarrassing; dose-manage"
  - name: mole_changes
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "MC1R stimulation can darken existing moles or create new ones; dermatological monitoring recommended in individuals with many moles or family history of melanoma"
  - name: appetite_suppression
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Meaningful reduction in hunger via MC4R; can assist fat loss"

interactions:
  - target: pt-141
    type: neutral
    severity: moderate
    description: "PT-141 (bremelanotide) is derived from MT-II with selectivity for MC4R; using both is redundant — choose based on goal (tanning = MT-II, pure libido = PT-141)"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: MC1R_melanogenesis
    description: "Activates MC1R on melanocytes; increases tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis; darkens skin without UV exposure"
  - pathway: MC4R_libido
    description: "Activates MC4R in paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus; stimulates dopamine and oxytocin release; drives pro-erectile and libido pathways"
  - pathway: MC3R_appetite
    description: "MC3R agonism in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus reduces food intake; complementary to MC4R appetite suppression"
