description: |
  MK-677 (Ibutamoren) is an oral, non-peptide ghrelin receptor agonist that stimulates
  pulsatile GH and IGF-1 secretion from the pituitary. Unlike exogenous HGH, MK-677
  works through the body's own GH axis, maintaining physiologic pulsatility. Phase II
  trials in elderly subjects and GH-deficient populations demonstrated significant
  increases in IGF-1 (up to 60–80% above baseline), lean mass gains, and improved bone
  density. Also increases deep sleep (slow-wave). 24-hour coverage from single daily oral
  dose. Does not suppress natural GH secretion. Main concerns: insulin resistance, cortisol
  elevation, water retention, and increased appetite (via ghrelin pathway). Not FDA-approved.

halfLife: "~24 hours"
onset: "Elevated IGF-1 within days; sleep improvement within 1–2 weeks; body composition changes over months"
duration: "Effects persist during dosing; IGF-1 returns to baseline within days of cessation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a) agonist; stimulates pulsatile GH release from anterior pituitary; elevates IGF-1 without suppressing endogenous GH axis"

dosing:
  min: 10
  typical: 25
  max: 50
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral (evening preferred for sleep/GH pulse alignment)"
  notes: "Most studied dose: 25mg/day. Lower doses (10–15mg) reduce hunger and insulin resistance side effects. Evening dosing aligns with natural GH pulsatility. No PCT required. Can be run continuously."

sideEffects:
  - name: increased_appetite
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Ghrelin agonism directly stimulates appetite; significant hunger increase, especially early. Can undermine cutting goals."
  - name: water_retention
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Dose-dependent fluid retention; often resolves after first few weeks. Reduce dose if significant."
  - name: insulin_resistance
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "GH-driven insulin antagonism; fasting glucose and HbA1c may rise. Monitor in pre-diabetic individuals. Dose reduction helps."
  - name: cortisol_elevation
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Modest cortisol increases documented in studies; usually not clinically significant"
  - name: lethargy
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Morning drowsiness, especially early in use; evening dosing mitigates this"
