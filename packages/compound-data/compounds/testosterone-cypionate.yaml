category: ANABOLIC
subcategory: testosterone_ester
legalStatus: SCHEDULED
clinicalPhase: "Approved"
description: |
  Testosterone Cypionate is a long-acting ester of testosterone, the primary endogenous
  male androgen. Approved for hypogonadism (TRT) and delayed puberty. The 8-day half-life
  allows weekly or twice-weekly injections, maintaining stable serum testosterone levels.
  The gold standard for TRT; extensively studied in clinical medicine. At supraphysiologic
  doses used in bodybuilding (200–600mg/week), it produces significant muscle hypertrophy,
  strength, and erythropoiesis but causes HPG axis suppression, erythrocytosis, and
  estrogen-related side effects via aromatization. Controlled substance (Schedule III).

halfLife: "~8 days"
onset: "1–2 weeks for androgen effects; peak levels at 72 hours post-injection"
duration: "Cycle length 8–16 weeks; suppression recovery 3–6 months without PCT"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Binds androgen receptor as full agonist; activates muscle, bone, erythropoiesis, and CNS AR programs; aromatizes to estradiol via CYP19A1"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Intramuscular injection weekly or E3.5D"
  notes: "TRT: 100–200mg/week. Performance: 300–600mg/week. Requires aromatase inhibitor at supraphysiologic doses to manage estrogen. PCT with Nolvadex/Clomid post-cycle mandatory. Controlled substance (Schedule III USA)."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Complete HPG axis shutdown at any dose; endogenous testosterone production ceases. Requires PCT or lifelong TRT if prolonged use."
  - name: erythrocytosis
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Stimulates EPO production; hematocrit elevation, thrombosis risk. Monitor CBC. Therapeutic phlebotomy may be needed."
  - name: aromatization_estrogen
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Converts to estradiol; gynecomastia, water retention, mood changes. Manage with AI (anastrozole, exemestane) if needed."

    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "HDL reduction, LDL increase at supraphysiologic doses. Cardiovascular risk with long-term performance use."

    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "LH/FSH suppression causes testicular shrinkage; HCG co-administration prevents this."
