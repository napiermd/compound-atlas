description: |
  TB-500 is a synthetic form of Thymosin Beta-4, a naturally occurring peptide found in
  nearly all human cells. It plays a central role in actin sequestration, cell migration,
  angiogenesis, and wound healing. Research use focuses on accelerating tendon, ligament,
  and muscle repair, reducing inflammation, and improving flexibility. Evidence comes
  primarily from animal models and human anecdote. Not approved for human use.

halfLife: "~4 hours plasma; tissue effects persist days to weeks"
onset: "1–2 weeks for subjective effects"
duration: "Cumulative over loading phase; maintenance monthly"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "Sequesters G-actin, promotes cell migration and angiogenesis via eNOS upregulation and anti-inflammatory cytokine modulation"

dosing:
  min: 2.5
  typical: 7.5
  max: 20
  unit: mg
  frequency: "2x/week (loading 4–6 weeks), then 2–2.5mg 2x/month maintenance"
  notes: "Loading: 5–20mg/week split 2 injections. Maintenance: 2–2.5mg 2x/month. Reconstitute with bacteriostatic water."

sideEffects:
