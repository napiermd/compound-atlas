# Testosterone Propionate — Short-acting testosterone ester; rapid onset, fine-tuning
slug: testosterone-propionate
name: Testosterone Propionate
aliases:
  - test prop
  - prop
  - T-Propionate
  - TP
category: ANABOLIC
subcategory: testosterone_ester
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Testosterone Propionate is a short-acting esterified testosterone with a half-life of
  2-3 days, requiring injections every other day (EOD) or every 3 days for stable blood
  levels. It is the fastest-acting injectable testosterone ester and provides rapid response
  to dose adjustments — useful for dialing in TRT, pre-competition body composition, or
  minimizing post-cycle recovery time. The frequent injection schedule is its primary
  limitation vs. longer esters. More popular in competitive bodybuilding where fast
  control of hormone levels is needed. FDA-approved for male hypogonadism and delayed
  puberty.

halfLife: "~2-3 days"
onset: "Testosterone elevation within 24-48 hours; anabolic effects 2-4 weeks"
duration: "Levels fall significantly within 3-4 days without re-injection"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular_injection
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "Esterified testosterone cleaved by esterases → free testosterone; identical mechanism to other testosterone esters; ester length determines release rate and half-life only"

dosing:
  min: 50
  typical: 100
  max: 150
  unit: mg
  frequency: "every other day (EOD)"
  notes: "EOD injections required for stable levels. 100mg EOD = ~350mg/week effective testosterone exposure. TRT: 50-100mg EOD. Performance: 100-150mg EOD. Monitor same markers as test enanthate. More injection site irritation than long-acting esters."

sideEffects:
  - name: injection_site_irritation
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Propionate ester causes more injection site discomfort than longer esters; rotate sites, use larger gauge needle, inject slowly"
  - name: injection_frequency
    severity: moderate
    frequency: certain
    notes: "EOD injections required — significant lifestyle burden vs. weekly enanthate"
  - name: estrogen_elevation
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Aromatizes to estradiol; AI management same as other testosterone forms"

interactions:
  - target: anastrozole
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "AI management essential with any aromatizing testosterone; frequency of AI dosing can match injection schedule for propionate"
  - target: trenbolone-acetate
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Both short-acting esters pair well — both EOD for matching pharmacokinetics; testosterone base required with trenbolone"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: testosterone_release
    description: "Ester bond hydrolyzed by tissue/blood esterases; releases free testosterone at rate determined by ester length; propionate = shortest common ester = fastest release"
  - pathway: androgen_receptor_agonism
    description: "Identical to all testosterone forms after ester cleavage; AR agonism drives anabolic and androgenic effects"
