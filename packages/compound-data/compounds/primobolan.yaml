description: |
  Primobolan (Metenolone) is a mild anabolic steroid available as injectable enanthate
  and oral acetate forms. DHT-derivative with no aromatization, low androgenicity,
  and minimal hepatotoxicity (particularly the injectable form). Historically used for
  muscle wasting, osteoporosis, and malnutrition. Known for "quality" lean muscle gains
  with minimal water retention and low side effect profile compared to other anabolics.
  Immune-modulating properties documented. Long associated with elite athletics due to
  perceived "clean" profile. Still causes HPG suppression. Schedule III controlled substance.

halfLife: "10–14 days (enanthate); 4–6 hours (acetate oral)"
onset: "3–4 weeks for noticeable muscle changes"
duration: "Suppression recovery 6–8 weeks post-cycle"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular
  - oral
mechanismShort: "DHT-derived anabolic; binds AR without aromatization; no estrogenic activity; anabolic with low androgenicity; notable immune-modulatory effects"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 800
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Injectable: once weekly IM. Oral: 50–150mg/day"
  notes: "Performance (injectable): 400–600mg/week. Oral is significantly less bioavailable and more hepatotoxic per unit. Often combined with testosterone. Schedule III controlled substance."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Suppresses HPG axis; less severe than testosterone or nandrolone but requires PCT for longer cycles"
  - name: lipid_changes
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "HDL reduction at higher doses; cardiovascular risk with long-term use"
  - name: hair_loss
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "DHT derivative; androgenic alopecia risk in predisposed individuals, though lower than testosterone"
  - name: hepatotoxicity
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Oral acetate form has mild hepatotoxicity (17-alpha-alkylated). Injectable enanthate does not."

mechanisms:
  - pathway: androgen_receptor_agonism
    description: "DHT-derived structure binds AR with moderate affinity; activates anabolic gene programs in muscle without conversion to estrogen"
  - pathway: no_aromatization
    description: "Cannot be aromatized to estrogen due to DHT-derived structure; eliminates estrogen-related side effects"
