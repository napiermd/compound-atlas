description: |
  Noopept is a synthetic dipeptide originally developed in Russia as a peptide mimic of
  the C-terminal fragment of piracetam. Rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and
  converts to cycloprolylglycine, an endogenous neuropeptide. Among the most potent
  nootropics by mass — effective at 10–30mg vs piracetam's 1,600–4,800mg. Stimulates
  NGF and BDNF expression; described as an anxiolytic-nootropic with memory-consolidating
  properties. Extensively studied in Russian pre-clinical and limited clinical literature
  (primarily post-stroke and traumatic brain injury). Gray-market legal status in the US
  and most Western countries. Sublingual administration significantly increases bioavailability.

halfLife: "~5–10 minutes (rapid hydrolysis); cycloprolylglycine metabolite is active"
onset: "15–30 minutes"
duration: "3–6 hours"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - sublingual
mechanismShort: "Dipeptide nootropic; metabolizes to cycloprolylglycine; upregulates NGF and BDNF; modulates AMPA and NMDA receptors; anxiolytic-nootropic profile"

dosing:
  min: 10
  typical: 20
  max: 30
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once or twice daily (sublingual preferred for bioavailability)"
  notes: "10–30mg is typical. Sublingual dosing bypasses hepatic first-pass. Start at 10mg to assess tolerance. Can be taken with choline source to reduce headaches. Not recommended >30mg."

sideEffects:
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Racetam-class headache from increased acetylcholine demand; choline supplementation (alpha-GPC, CDP-choline) typically resolves this"
  - name: irritability
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Some users report irritability or mild anxiety at higher doses or with prolonged use"
  - name: brain_fog_rebound
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Some users report cognitive fog on days off after extended use; usually resolves"
