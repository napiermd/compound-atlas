  Epithalon (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) is a synthetic tetrapeptide developed by the St. Petersburg
  Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology by Prof. Vladimir Khavinson. It is derived from
  epithalamin (pineal gland extract) and is one of the most studied bioregulatory peptides.
  Russian longitudinal studies over 20+ years show reduced all-cause mortality (~50%), cancer
  incidence reduction, and significant lifespan extension. Its primary mechanism involves
  activating telomerase to elongate telomeres in somatic cells — one of very few compounds
  with direct telomerase-activating evidence in humans. Also normalizes circadian rhythm
  via pineal gland regulation. Widely used in longevity-focused protocols.

halfLife: "~0.5-2 hours (plasma); cellular effects persist"
onset: "Circadian/sleep effects within days; telomere effects accumulate over months-years"
duration: "2-3 cycles/year with effects accumulating over time"
