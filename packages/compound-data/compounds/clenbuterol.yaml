description: |
  Clenbuterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist originally developed for asthma
  treatment (approved in some countries for horses/livestock; not FDA-approved for human use).
  It is widely used in bodybuilding and weight loss communities for its thermogenic and
  anti-catabolic effects. Mechanism: beta-2 receptor activation increases cAMP, activating
  hormone-sensitive lipase in adipocytes and increasing metabolic rate by 5-10%. Also
  reduces skeletal muscle proteolysis. WADA prohibits it; contaminated meat has caused
  multiple positive doping tests. Side effect profile is significant and dose-dependent.
  Despite widespread use, no human RCTs specifically for fat loss exist.

halfLife: "~35-40 hours"
onset: "Thermogenic effect within hours; body temperature elevation measurable within 1 hour"
duration: "Half-life ~36 hours; effects cumulative over use period"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist; increases cAMP via Gs → activates PKA → phosphorylates HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) → lipolysis; thermogenic via uncoupled mitochondrial respiration"

dosing:
  min: 20
  typical: 80
  max: 160
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "daily (in cycles of 2 weeks on/2 weeks off)"
  notes: "Start at 20mcg, increase by 20mcg/day until desired response or side effects. 2-week on/off cycles to prevent beta-2 receptor desensitization. Taper off at end of cycle. Supplement taurine (3-5g/day) to prevent muscle cramps."

sideEffects:
  - name: tachycardia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Heart rate increase of 20-40 BPM common; beta-1 spillover at higher doses; contraindicated in arrhythmias"
  - name: muscle_cramps
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Taurine depletion causes severe cramping; taurine 3-5g/day is mandatory supplementation"
  - name: tremors
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Dose-dependent hand tremors; usually improve with continued use or dose reduction"
  - name: hypokalemia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Beta-2 agonism drives K+ into cells; supplement potassium, monitor ECG in high-dose use"
  - name: cardiac_hypertrophy
    severity: severe
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Chronic high-dose use associated with pathological cardiac hypertrophy; cardiac monitoring recommended"

interactions:
  - target: t3-liothyronine
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Classic cutting stack: T3 upregulates beta-2 receptors (preventing clenbuterol desensitization) while increasing metabolic rate via thyroid axis — potently synergistic for fat loss"
  - target: taurine
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Mandatory pairing: clenbuterol depletes taurine causing severe cramps; taurine supplementation is protective rather than synergistic"
