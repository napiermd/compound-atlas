description: |
  N-Acetyl Cysteine is the acetylated form of the amino acid cysteine and the primary
  rate-limiting precursor for glutathione synthesis. It is one of the most evidence-backed
  compounds in medicine — FDA-approved for acetaminophen overdose and mucolytic therapy,
  with extensive research in mental health (OCD, bipolar, addiction), PCOS, respiratory
  disease, liver protection, and exercise recovery. The GlyNAC (glycine + NAC) combination
  has shown reversal of multiple aging hallmarks in older adults in randomized trials.
  The FDA briefly attempted to remove NAC from the supplement market in 2021-2022 but
  reversed course; it remains widely available.

halfLife: "~6 hours"
onset: "Glutathione elevation within 1-2 hours; psychiatric effects weeks; longevity effects months"
duration: "GSH elevation persists 8-12 hours after dose; chronic benefits with daily use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Cysteine donor for glutathione synthesis; direct thiol antioxidant; mucolytic via disulfide bond cleavage; modulates glutamate signaling via cystine-glutamate antiporter"

dosing:
  min: 600
  typical: 1200
  max: 2400
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Take with food. GlyNAC protocol: combine with glycine (1.33g/kg each) for maximal GSH restoration. Split dosing improves tolerability."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_nausea
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most common side effect; take with food, start low (600mg), titrate up"
  - name: rotten_egg_odor
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Sulfur smell in urine and breath; harmless"
  - name: bronchospasm
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Rare with oral form; more relevant with inhaled formulation"

interactions:
  - target: glycine
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "GlyNAC combination provides both rate-limiting glutathione precursors simultaneously; superior GSH restoration vs either alone"
  - target: vitamin-c
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
