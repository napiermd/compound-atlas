clinicalPhase: "Phase III"
description: |
  Survodutide is an investigational once-weekly dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist
  developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Zealand Pharma. Phase II trials demonstrated ~19%
  weight loss at 46 weeks. Currently in Phase III for obesity and metabolic dysfunction-
  associated steatohepatitis (MASH/NASH). Glucagon co-agonism provides additional hepatic
  fat reduction beyond GLP-1 alone, making it particularly relevant for fatty liver disease.
  Not available outside clinical trials.

halfLife: "~7 days (estimated)"
onset: "Weeks for weight loss; appetite suppression within days"
duration: "Ongoing; effects reverse after discontinuation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist; adds hepatic fat mobilization and increased energy expenditure to GLP-1 satiety effects"

dosing:
