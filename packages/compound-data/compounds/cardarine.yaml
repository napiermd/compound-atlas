description: |
  Cardarine (GW501516) is a PPARδ agonist (not technically a SARM) that dramatically
  increases fat oxidation, endurance, and metabolic rate by activating genes involved in
  fatty acid catabolism. Human clinical development was halted by GlaxoSmithKline in 2007
  after accelerated tumor development was observed across multiple organ systems in long-term
  rodent toxicity studies. Despite this, it remains widely used in athletic communities.
  The cancer risk in humans is unknown but the animal data is consistent and concerning.
  This profile is presented for harm reduction purposes only.

  WARNING: Cardarine caused rapid cancer development in animal studies at doses comparable
  to human use. The carcinogenic mechanism (PPARδ activation promoting cell survival and
  proliferation) is not species-specific. Use in humans carries unknown but potentially
  serious cancer risk.

halfLife: "16–24 hours"
onset: "Days for endurance; 2–4 weeks for fat loss"
duration: "Effects active during dosing period"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "PPARδ/β agonist; transcriptionally activates fatty acid oxidation genes (CPT1, ABCA1) in skeletal muscle; dramatically increases mitochondrial biogenesis and fat burning"

dosing:
  min: 5
  typical: 10
  max: 20
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral"
  notes: "WARNING: GlaxoSmithKline halted all development due to cancer findings in animals. No safe dose established. 10–20mg/day used historically before safety data emerged. Do not exceed 8 weeks. High personal risk."

sideEffects:
  - name: potential_carcinogenesis
    severity: severe
    frequency: unknown
    notes: "CRITICAL: Consistent tumor promotion across multiple organ systems in rodent studies at human-equivalent doses. Mechanism (PPARδ promoting cell survival) applies to humans. Unknown risk, but biologically plausible."
