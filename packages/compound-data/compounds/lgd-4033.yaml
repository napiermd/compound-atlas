description: |
  LGD-4033 (Ligandrol) is a potent oral SARM with Phase I safety data and Phase II trial
  data for hip fracture recovery (VK5211, 1–2mg/day). Significantly more anabolic than
  ostarine at milligram doses — 1mg/day in Phase I produced ~1.2kg lean mass gain.
  Widely used in fitness communities for bulking. Causes robust testosterone suppression
  even at low doses. Not approved for human use. WADA-prohibited. Among the most detected
  substances in athlete doping cases.

halfLife: "24–36 hours"
onset: "1–2 weeks for noticeable strength; 4–6 weeks for body composition"
duration: "Suppression persists 4–6 weeks post-cycle"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "High-affinity selective AR agonist; near-complete receptor occupancy at low doses produces significant muscle anabolism with moderate bone activation"

dosing:
  min: 2
  typical: 10
  max: 20
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral"
  notes: "Research/clinical doses: 0.1–22mg in trials. Fitness community: 5–20mg/day 6–12 weeks. Significant suppression at 10mg+ requires PCT. Do not exceed 20mg."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Strong dose-dependent suppression of LH, FSH, and testosterone. Near-complete suppression at 10mg+. Robust PCT required (Nolvadex or Clomid 4–6 weeks)."
