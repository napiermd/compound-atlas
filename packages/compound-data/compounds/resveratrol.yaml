description: |
  Resveratrol is a stilbenoid polyphenol found in grape skins, Japanese knotweed (highest
  concentration), and berries. It was catapulted to prominence by David Sinclair's work on
  SIRT1 activation as a potential caloric restriction mimetic. Trans-resveratrol is the active
  form. Bioavailability is notoriously poor with standard oral dosing (~1%) but is dramatically
  improved with food (particularly fat), micronized formulations, or combination with piperine.
  Human RCT data shows benefits for cardiovascular markers, insulin sensitivity, and cognitive
  function in older adults. Most potent when dosed with a meal high in fat.

halfLife: "~1-3 hours (trans-resveratrol); sulfate/glucuronide conjugates persist longer"
onset: "Acute metabolic effects 1-2 hours; cardiovascular/longevity effects weeks to months"
duration: "Short half-life requires twice-daily dosing or sustained-release form"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "SIRT1 deacetylase activation (caloric restriction mimetic); AMPK activation; NF-kB inhibition; eNOS upregulation; autophagy induction; aromatase inhibition"

dosing:
  min: 250
  typical: 500
  max: 2000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day with meals"
  notes: "Take with high-fat meal for 5-10x improved absorption. Micronized or liposomal formulations preferred. Combine with quercetin for synergistic senolytic protocol. Avoid with anticoagulants (mild anti-platelet effect)."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_discomfort
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Nausea and loose stools at higher doses; take with food"
  - name: estrogenic_effects
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Weak phytoestrogen at high doses; generally neutral in most users"
  - name: anticoagulant_interaction
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Mild platelet inhibition; caution with warfarin or other anticoagulants"

interactions:
  - target: quercetin
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
