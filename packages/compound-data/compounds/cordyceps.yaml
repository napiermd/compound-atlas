  Cordyceps is a genus of parasitic fungi historically used in Tibetan and Chinese medicine
  for fatigue, endurance, and libido. Cordyceps militaris is the commercially cultivated
  species with the highest cordycepin content. Evidence supports increased VO2max and
  aerobic capacity, improved oxygen utilization, ATP production enhancement, testosterone
  support, and anti-fatigue effects. CS-4 (fermented mycelium) is the form used in most
  clinical trials. More recent data points to adenosine receptor modulation and mitochondrial
  biogenesis as primary mechanisms.

halfLife: "Cordycepin: ~1-2 hours"
onset: "Performance effects 1-4 weeks with consistent dosing"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Cordycepin (adenosine analog) modulates adenosine receptors; adenosine 5'-monophosphate increases ATP availability; AMPK activation drives mitochondrial biogenesis"

dosing:
  min: 1000
  typical: 3000
  max: 6000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "CS-4 or Cordyceps militaris standardized extract. Quality varies widely — choose brands with verified cordycepin content. Stack with other performance supplements."
