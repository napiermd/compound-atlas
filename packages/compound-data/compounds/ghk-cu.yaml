description: |
  GHK-Cu is a naturally occurring copper complex found in human plasma, saliva, and urine.
  Plasma levels decline from ~200 ng/mL at age 20 to ~80 ng/mL by age 60. GHK-Cu activates
  genes involved in tissue remodeling, collagen synthesis, antioxidant defense, and
  anti-inflammatory signaling. Topical formulations are widely available OTC and
  well-established for skin aging and wound healing. Injectable use is experimental.

halfLife: "Minutes in plasma; tissue effects are prolonged"
onset: "Topical: 4–8 weeks; Injectable: 1–2 weeks"
duration: "Cumulative with chronic use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - topical
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Activates collagen synthesis and wound healing genes; broad anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects via Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways"

dosing:
  min: 1
  typical: 2
  max: 5
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Daily subcutaneous (injectable); 2x/day topical"
  notes: "Topical: 1–2% concentration. Injectable: 1–5mg/day SC in research context. Topical is the established, lower-risk route."
