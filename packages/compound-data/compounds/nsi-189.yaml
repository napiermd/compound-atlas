clinicalPhase: "Phase II"
description: |
  NSI-189 is a novel benzylpiperazine-aminopyridine compound developed by Neuralstem Inc.
  specifically to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis — growth of new neurons — in adult
  humans. Phase I demonstrated hippocampal volume increases (measurable on MRI) and
  Phase II trials in major depressive disorder showed mixed but promising results.
  The compound acts through an unknown mechanism to increase hippocampal stem cell
  proliferation and differentiation. Used experimentally for depression, cognitive
  enhancement, and post-traumatic brain injury recovery. Not approved. Available from
  research chemical vendors. Represents a genuinely novel mechanism with legitimate
  clinical data, though Phase II results were mixed.
