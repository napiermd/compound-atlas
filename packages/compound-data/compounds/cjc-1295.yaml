description: |
  CJC-1295 is a synthetic analog of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Two forms
  exist: with DAC (Drug Affinity Complex) extending half-life to 6–8 days via albumin
  binding, and without DAC (Modified GRF 1-29) with a 30-minute half-life mimicking
  natural pulsatile GH release. Used to stimulate GH and IGF-1 for muscle growth, fat
  loss, recovery, and anti-aging. Commonly combined with ipamorelin for synergistic GH
  pulse amplification.

halfLife: "~30 min without DAC; 6–8 days with DAC"
onset: "15–30 minutes post-injection (GH pulse)"
duration: "GH pulse 2–3 hours; IGF-1 elevation sustained with DAC"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "GHRH receptor agonist on pituitary somatotrophs; stimulates pulsatile GH release and downstream IGF-1 production"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 300
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1–3x/day without DAC; 1–2x/week with DAC"
  notes: "Without DAC: inject fasted before bed or AM. With DAC: once or twice weekly sufficient. Always combine with GHRP for maximum effect."

sideEffects:
  - name: water_retention
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "From elevated GH/IGF-1; typically mild, resolves with dose reduction"

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Paresthesias from GH elevation; transient"
  - name: carpal_tunnel_syndrome
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "At higher doses or prolonged use; fluid retention compresses carpal tunnel"

    frequency: common
    notes: "Redness, itching; rotate sites"

interactions:
  - target: ipamorelin
