# Dihexa — HGF potentiator, cognitive peptide
slug: dihexa
name: Dihexa
aliases:
  - PNB-0408
  - N-hexanoic-Tyr-Ile-(6) aminohexanoic amide
category: NOOTROPIC
subcategory: neurogenic
legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
clinicalPhase: "Preclinical"
description: |
  Dihexa is a small peptide derived from angiotensin IV, designed to potentiate
  hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met. In animal models it produces
  dramatic improvements in cognitive function, synaptogenesis, and long-term potentiation —
  reportedly 7-orders of magnitude more potent than BDNF at driving synaptic connectivity.
  Developed at Washington State University. No human clinical trial data exists. Oral and
  transdermal bioavailability are both reported. Extreme caution warranted: HGF
  potentiation could theoretically accelerate existing malignancies.

halfLife: "Unknown; estimated days due to high lipophilicity"
onset: "Days to weeks in animal models"
duration: "Extended; lipophilic accumulation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
