  Vitamin K2 (menaquinone) is the tissue-directing form of vitamin K, distinct from K1 (dietary
  clotting factor). Its primary role is activating matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteocalcin —
  proteins that direct calcium into bone and prevent arterial calcification. K2 deficiency
  is common (especially with high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation) and correlates with aortic
  and coronary artery calcification. MK-7 (fermented soy/natto) has a longer half-life and
  higher bioactivity than MK-4. The Rotterdam Study showed 50μg MK-7/day associated with
  57% reduction in aortic calcification progression and 52% reduction in cardiovascular death.
  Essential companion to vitamin D3.

halfLife: "MK-4: ~1-2 hours; MK-7: ~72 hours"
onset: "Carboxylation markers improve 4-12 weeks; cardiovascular calcification is very long-term"
duration: "Daily dosing required to maintain tissue saturation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase; activates MGP (prevents arterial calcification) and osteocalcin (bone mineralization, glucose metabolism)"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 400
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "MK-7 preferred over MK-4 for cardiovascular protection. Take with fat-containing meal (fat-soluble vitamin). Mandatory companion to vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent soft-tissue calcification."

sideEffects:
  - name: warfarin_interaction
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "CRITICAL: K2 reverses warfarin anticoagulation — contraindicated in patients on warfarin unless dose is carefully adjusted with physician oversight"

interactions:
  - target: vitamin-d3
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "D3 drives calcium absorption; K2 directs that calcium to bone and away from arteries — essential pairing. High-dose D3 without K2 risks soft tissue calcification."
  - target: vitamin-c
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both support vascular health by different mechanisms; K2 prevents calcification, vitamin C supports collagen synthesis in vessel walls"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: MGP_carboxylation
    description: "Activates matrix Gla protein (MGP) via gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues; MGP is the most potent known inhibitor of vascular calcification"
  - pathway: osteocalcin_activation
    description: "Carboxylates osteocalcin in osteoblasts, enabling bone calcium binding; also regulates insulin sensitivity and testosterone production"
  - pathway: vascular_calcification_prevention
    description: "Via activated MGP, directly blocks calcium crystal deposition in arterial smooth muscle cells and valve leaflets"
  - pathway: glucose_metabolism
    description: "Osteocalcin (activated by K2) acts as a hormone promoting adiponectin and insulin secretion, improving metabolic health"
