description: |
  Methylene Blue is an FDA-approved medication (for methemoglobinemia and urinary tract
  infections) with a documented history as a cognitive enhancer dating to the 19th century.
  At low doses (0.5–4mg/kg), it acts as a mitochondrial electron carrier, improving
  oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and ATP production. Extensive preclinical evidence
  for neuroprotection, memory enhancement, and Alzheimer's/dementia-related mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Used experimentally for cognitive enhancement, anti-aging, and mood
  optimization. Hormetic dose-response: low doses are beneficial while high doses become
  pro-oxidant and potentially harmful. Turns urine blue — benign side effect.
  No significant safety concerns at low doses. Available OTC as pharmaceutical grade.

halfLife: "~5–6 hours"
onset: "Acute cognitive effects within 1–2 hours; mitochondrial effects cumulative"
duration: "4–8 hours per dose; blue urine for ~24 hours"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Alternative mitochondrial electron carrier in complex I-IV chain; improves oxidative phosphorylation; MAO inhibitor; antioxidant at low doses; hormetic dose-response"

dosing:
  min: 0.5
  typical: 10
  max: 80
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral (avoid late evening due to potential stimulant effects)"
  notes: "Cognitive enhancement: 0.5–4mg/kg or 5–20mg total. Pharmaceutical-grade required (not industrial methylene blue). Low doses (under 1mg/kg) most consistent for cognitive benefit. High doses (>4mg/kg) may be counterproductive. Turns urine blue."

sideEffects:
  - name: blue_urine_discoloration
    severity: mild
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Harmless blue/green urine discoloration; resolves within 24–48 hours of cessation"
  - name: serotonin_syndrome_risk
    severity: severe
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "MAO inhibitor properties — potentially dangerous interaction with SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tramadol. Serotonin syndrome risk. Do not combine."
  - name: nausea
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild GI upset at higher doses; take with food"
  - name: skin_discoloration
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Blue skin tint at high doses; harmless but cosmetically undesirable"

interactions:
  - target: semaglutide
    type: unknown
    severity: mild
    description: "No established interaction; both affect metabolic pathways but no documented interaction"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: mitochondrial_electron_carrier
    description: "Alternative electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain; accepts electrons from NADH and donates to cytochrome c, bypassing dysfunctional complex I; improves ATP production efficiency"
  - pathway: MAO_inhibition
    description: "Inhibits monoamine oxidase; increases monoamine neurotransmitter levels (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine); basis for mood and cognitive effects"
  - pathway: antioxidant
    description: "At low doses, acts as antioxidant by accepting electrons from superoxide and other ROS; at high doses, becomes pro-oxidant"
  - pathway: tau_aggregation_inhibition
    description: "Inhibits tau protein aggregation; studied as potential Alzheimer's disease modifier"
