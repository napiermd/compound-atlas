  Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia) is a Southeast Asian medicinal plant root with
  evidence for increasing free testosterone in men with suboptimal testosterone levels.
  Clinical trials (primarily using standardized 200–400mg aqueous root extract) show
  modest but statistically significant increases in free testosterone (10–40%) in
  hypogonadal-range men, older men, and those under stress — likely through reduction
  of SHBG and cortisol-mediated HPG suppression. Does not appear to increase testosterone
  beyond the normal physiologic range in healthy young men. Human trials also support
  improvement in male fertility parameters, stress hormone reduction, and muscle strength
  in resistance-trained subjects. Well-tolerated. Popular "natural" alternative to TRT
  among men with borderline low testosterone.

halfLife: "Unknown (herb extract; multiple active compounds)"
onset: "2–4 weeks for hormonal effects; benefits accumulate over 8+ weeks"
duration: "Effects likely require continued supplementation to maintain"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Reduces SHBG and cortisol to free more testosterone; possible direct LH/FSH stimulation; eurycomanone (active quassinoid) drives most studied effects"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 400
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral (standardized extract)"
  notes: "Clinical studies used 200–400mg/day of standardized root extract (200:1 water-soluble extract most studied). LJ100 brand used in most trials. Effects most pronounced in men with low-normal or below-normal testosterone."

sideEffects:
  - name: insomnia
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Stimulatory properties in some users; avoid late evening dosing"
  - name: restlessness
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mildly stimulating adaptogen; agitation in sensitive individuals at higher doses"
