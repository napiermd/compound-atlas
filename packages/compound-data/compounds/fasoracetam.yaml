description: |
  Fasoracetam is a novel racetam that reached Phase III trials (NFC-1) for ADHD in adolescents
  with glutamatergic gene variants — making it unique as the only racetam with substantial
  Phase III clinical data. Its mechanism differs from older racetams: it upregulates and
  restores mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptor) density that has been downregulated by
  excessive stimulant use or glutamatergic dysfunction. This makes it particularly useful
  for preventing or reversing tolerance to ADHD medications and racetam tolerance. Also
  acts on GABA-B receptors (anxiolytic). More potent per milligram than piracetam.
  No approved medical use in US; available as research chemical.

halfLife: "~1-2 hours"
onset: "Acute anti-anxiety effects within 30-60 min; mGluR restoration days to weeks"
duration: "mGluR upregulation builds with consistent use; effects present during supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - sublingual
mechanismShort: "Upregulates mGluR2/3 (Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors); GABA-B receptor agonism (anxiolytic); choline uptake facilitation; reverses mGluR downregulation from stimulant use"

dosing:
  min: 15
  typical: 30
  max: 100
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-3x/day"
  notes: "Highly potent — much smaller doses than other racetams. Start at 15mg. Sublingual has faster onset. Take with choline source (alpha-GPC). Useful as tolerance-reversal agent cycled with other racetams or stimulants."

sideEffects:
  - name: fatigue
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "GABA-B agonism may cause sedation in some; take in morning or afternoon"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Choline demand; always stack with alpha-GPC or CDP-choline"

interactions:
  - target: alpha-gpc
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "All racetams increase acetylcholine demand; alpha-GPC is the essential choline source for fasoracetam — always combine"
  - target: modafinil
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Fasoracetam may help maintain or restore dopaminergic/glutamatergic sensitivity blunted by chronic modafinil use; useful combination for tolerance management"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: mGluR_upregulation
    description: "Upregulates Group II (mGluR2/3) metabotropic glutamate receptor expression; restores glutamatergic sensitivity and reduces excess glutamatergic drive"
  - pathway: GABA_B_agonism
    description: "Acts as GABA-B receptor agonist in cortex and limbic system; produces anxiolytic effects without direct GABA-A benzodiazepine mechanism"
  - pathway: choline_uptake
    description: "Facilitates high-affinity choline uptake in hippocampus; increases acetylcholine synthesis rate"
