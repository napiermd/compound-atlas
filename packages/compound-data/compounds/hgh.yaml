description: |
  Human Growth Hormone (somatropin) is FDA-approved recombinant hGH identical to
  endogenous pituitary GH. Approved indications include adult GH deficiency, pediatric
  GH deficiency, Turner syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, HIV wasting, and short bowel
  syndrome. In healthy adults, GH drives IGF-1 production (primarily hepatic), promoting
  lipolysis, lean mass maintenance, and tissue repair. At supraphysiologic doses used in
  athletics, GH produces significant fat loss, tissue repair enhancement, and modest
  lean mass gains; direct muscle growth effects are largely IGF-1 mediated. Long-term
  supraphysiologic use carries risks of diabetes, acromegaly-like changes, and
  carpal tunnel syndrome. Strict prescription control; banned by WADA.

halfLife: "~20–30 minutes (endogenous-like pulsatile); effects persist hours via IGF-1"
onset: "Fat loss: 2–4 weeks. Tissue repair: weeks. Muscle changes: months."
duration: "IGF-1 elevation persists 12–24 hours post-injection"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "Binds GH receptor on hepatocytes → IGF-1 production; directly stimulates lipolysis in adipose; promotes nitrogen retention and tissue repair via IGF-1/mTOR/PI3K"

dosing:
  min: 1
  typical: 2
  max: 6
  unit: IU
  frequency: "Once daily subcutaneous injection (typically evening or pre-sleep)"
  notes: "Anti-aging/TRT-adjacent: 1–2 IU/day. Performance: 2–4 IU/day. Bodybuilding extremes: 4–6 IU/day. Fasting morning injection maximizes lipolysis. Prescription only — significant legal risk. WADA prohibited."

sideEffects:
  - name: carpal_tunnel_syndrome
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Fluid retention and nerve compression at higher doses; often dose-dependent and reversible on discontinuation"
  - name: insulin_resistance
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "GH antagonizes insulin action; glucose intolerance and elevated HbA1c at supraphysiologic doses. Diabetes risk with long-term use."
