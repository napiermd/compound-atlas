  Fisetin is a flavonoid found in strawberries, apples, and persimmons that has emerged as
  one of the most potent and bioavailable senolytic compounds — molecules that selectively
  eliminate senescent ("zombie") cells that accumulate with aging and drive inflammation.
  The Buck Institute and Mayo Clinic have identified fisetin as the most effective natural
  senolytic in systematic screening, with 40-50% clearance of senescent cells in aged mice
  resulting in significant health and lifespan improvements. Human clinical trials are active
  (NCT04210986 in Alzheimer's, NCT04733534 in COVID Long Haulers). Additionally has strong
  neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects independent of senolytic activity.

halfLife: "~3.5-4 hours; episodic high-dose protocol preferred"
onset: "Senolytic effect: single 2-3 day pulse; neuroprotective effects: weeks of daily dosing"
duration: "Senolytic pulses monthly; continuous low dosing for neuroprotection"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-W inhibitor (senolytic) — selectively kills senescent cells dependent on these anti-apoptotic proteins; Nrf2 activation; SIRT1 activation; mTOR inhibition"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 500
  max: 3000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Senolytic: 1000-3000mg/day × 2-3 days per month; Neuroprotective: 100-500mg/day"
  notes: "Take with fat for best absorption (lipophilic flavonoid). Piperlongumine or quercetin may enhance senolytic effect. Senolytic protocol: 20mg/kg for 2 consecutive days monthly. Standard supplement dose: 100-500mg daily."

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "At high senolytic doses; take with fat-containing meal"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare

interactions:
  - target: quercetin
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Both are senolytics acting on Bcl-2 family proteins; together with dasatinib form the most studied senolytic combinations in clinical trials"
  - target: resveratrol
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Fisetin + resveratrol combination activates complementary longevity pathways: fisetin clears senescent cells, resveratrol activates SIRT1 anti-aging pathway"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: senolytic_bcl_inhibition
    description: "Inhibits anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-W proteins that senescent cells depend on for survival; triggers selective apoptosis of senescent cells"
  - pathway: Nrf2_activation
    description: "Activates Nrf2-ARE pathway, inducing antioxidant and cytoprotective gene expression — protecting normal cells during senolytic activity"
  - pathway: SIRT1_activation
    description: "Direct SIRT1 activator via allosteric mechanism; deacetylates FOXO and PGC-1alpha for longevity gene expression"
  - pathway: neuroplasticity
    description: "Increases BDNF, activates ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in neurons; neuroprotective independently of senolytic effects"
