  Ginkgo biloba is one of the most extensively studied herbs for cognitive function, with
  a unique combination of mechanisms targeting cerebrovascular circulation, platelet-activating
  factor (PAF) inhibition, and antioxidant activity. EGb 761 (standardized extract) is
  the most studied formulation. Meta-analyses confirm modest but significant improvements
  in cognitive symptoms of dementia and age-related cognitive decline. Civilian and military
  studies show acute cognitive benefits in healthy adults. Bilobalide has neuroprotective
  properties distinct from its vascular effects. One of the most used supplements globally,
  with a robust safety profile.

halfLife: "Ginkgolides: ~3-7 hours; bilobalide: ~3 hours"
onset: "Cerebrovascular effects acute (1-2 hours); cognitive improvements 4-12 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "PAF (platelet-activating factor) antagonism; inhibits phosphodiesterase → increased cGMP; free radical scavenging (flavonoids); inhibits EAA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity (bilobalide)"

dosing:
  min: 120
  typical: 240
  max: 360
  unit: mg
  frequency: "2-3x/day"
  notes: "EGb 761 standardized extract (24% flavone glycosides, 6% terpene lactones). Split dosing maintains stable levels. Take with food. Interactions with anticoagulants — see below."

sideEffects:
