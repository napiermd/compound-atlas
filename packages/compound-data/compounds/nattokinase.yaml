description: |
  Nattokinase is a serine protease enzyme extracted from natto (fermented soybeans) with
  direct fibrinolytic activity — it degrades fibrin clots by the same pathway as plasmin
  but is stable orally. Multiple human RCTs demonstrate: reduced blood viscosity, improved
  blood flow velocity, reduced clotting factors (fibrinogen, PAI-1), modest blood pressure
  reduction, and improved cardiovascular markers. Importantly, a 2022 RCT demonstrated
  nattokinase reduced coronary artery calcium score progression and atherosclerotic plaque
  volume, making it a compelling supplement for cardiovascular risk reduction alongside
  vitamin K2. Often combined with serrapeptase (another fibrinolytic enzyme).

halfLife: "Active enzyme: ~8-11 hours of fibrinolytic activity"
onset: "Fibrinolytic activity within 4-8 hours; cardiovascular marker improvements 4-12 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Direct fibrin degradation (cleaves Bβ chain); activates tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase; degrades PAI-1; reduces blood viscosity and platelet aggregation"

dosing:
  min: 2000
  typical: 4000
  max: 8000
  unit: FU
  frequency: "1-2x/day (away from meals)"
  notes: "Fibrinolytic Units (FU) or NSP units — not mg. 2000-4000 FU is typical. Take on empty stomach for best fibrinolytic activity. Do not combine with pharmaceutical anticoagulants without physician oversight. Discontinue before surgery."

sideEffects:
  - name: bleeding_risk
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Fibrinolytic activity increases bleeding risk; avoid with anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct oral anticoagulants)"
  - name: GI_discomfort
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Occasional nausea; take on empty stomach at non-mealtime helps"

interactions:
  - target: vitamin-k2
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Nattokinase degrades existing fibrin and reduces clotting factors; K2 prevents new arterial calcification — complementary cardiovascular protection addressing different aspects of arterial health"
  - target: fish-oil
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary cardiovascular support: omega-3s reduce triglycerides and platelet aggregation, nattokinase reduces fibrinogen and blood viscosity"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: fibrinolysis
    description: "Directly cleaves fibrin Bβ chain at multiple sites; degrades cross-linked fibrin clots similarly to plasmin"
  - pathway: tPA_activation
    description: "Activates tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), amplifying endogenous fibrinolytic system by converting plasminogen to plasmin"
  - pathway: PAI_1_degradation
    description: "Degrades plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), removing the primary brake on endogenous fibrinolysis"
  - pathway: blood_viscosity
    description: "Reduces fibrinogen (a major determinant of viscosity), reducing whole blood viscosity and improving microcirculatory flow"
