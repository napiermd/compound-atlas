  Creatine monohydrate is one of the most extensively researched dietary supplements.
  It increases phosphocreatine stores in muscle, supporting ATP regeneration during
  high-intensity exercise. Benefits extend beyond performance to include cognitive
  function, neuroprotection, and potential anti-aging effects.
