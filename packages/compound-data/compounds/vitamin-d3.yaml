description: |
  Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a fat-soluble secosteroid hormone precursor, synthesized
  in skin upon UV-B exposure and obtained through diet and supplementation. Converted to
  25(OH)D3 (calcidiol) in liver, then to active 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) in kidneys.
  Calcitriol regulates calcium/phosphate homeostasis and activates vitamin D receptors
  (VDR) present in virtually every cell type. Deficiency (25-OH-D <20 ng/mL) is pandemic,
  affecting >40% of Americans. Beyond bone metabolism, VDR signaling regulates immunity,
  muscle function, cardiovascular health, and gene expression of hundreds of genes.
  Large RCTs (VITAL, etc.) have refined the CV/cancer benefit picture: mortality and cancer
  benefits seen in true deficiency; supplementation in already-replete individuals shows
  less clear benefit. Safe at standard doses; toxicity only at extreme doses (>10,000 IU/day
  long-term without monitoring).

halfLife: "25(OH)D3: ~2–3 weeks"
onset: "Serum 25-OH-D rises within days; clinical effects over weeks to months"
duration: "Tissue stores persist weeks after cessation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Precursor to calcitriol; binds vitamin D receptor (nuclear receptor) in all cell types; regulates calcium homeostasis, immunity, muscle function, and expression of 200+ genes"

dosing:
  min: 1000
  typical: 5000
  max: 10000
  unit: IU
  frequency: "Once daily oral with fat-containing meal"
  notes: "Optimal 25-OH-D level: 40–60 ng/mL (consensus varies; 30+ for deficiency correction). Most deficient individuals need 5,000 IU/day to reach optimal range. Co-supplementation with K2 (MK-7, 100–200mcg) helps direct calcium to bone. Check 25-OH-D blood levels before and after starting."

sideEffects:
  - name: hypercalcemia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Only at very high doses (>10,000 IU/day long-term without monitoring). Symptoms: nausea, weakness, polyuria, confusion. Monitor 25-OH-D levels."
  - name: hypercalciuria
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Kidney stone risk in susceptible individuals at higher doses; adequate hydration and K2 co-supplementation reduce risk"

interactions:
  - target: fish-oil
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
