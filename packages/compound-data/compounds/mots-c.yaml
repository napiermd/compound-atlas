clinicalPhase: "Preclinical"
description: |
  MOTS-c is a 16-amino-acid peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome (12S rRNA region),
  making it the first mitochondria-derived peptide identified. It acts as a metabolic
  regulator, improving insulin sensitivity, activating AMPK, and mimicking exercise
  adaptations. Circulating levels decline with age and in metabolic disease. Animal data
  shows reversal of diet-induced obesity, improved glucose tolerance, and extended
  lifespan. Currently in early Phase I human trials. Compelling candidate for metabolic
  disease, longevity, and performance.

halfLife: "Unknown in humans; hours estimated"
onset: "Days to weeks in animal models"
duration: "Ongoing dosing required for sustained effects"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling via AMPK and AICAR; improves insulin sensitivity, metabolic flexibility, and exercise capacity"

dosing:
