description: |
  Maca is a Peruvian cruciferous root vegetable (Lepidium meyenii) grown at high altitude in
  the Andes. The most replicated evidence is for libido enhancement (multiple RCTs, both sexes),
  SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction reversal (notable given the population using SSRIs), and
  semen quality improvement. Evidence for testosterone increase is mixed — most well-controlled
  trials find no direct androgen elevation despite strong libido effects, suggesting an
  independent mechanism. Three color variants (yellow, red, black) have distinct phytochemical
  profiles with yellow being most common and black showing strongest nootropic effects in
  animal studies.

halfLife: "Glucosinolates and macamides: poorly characterized"
onset: "Libido effects: 4-8 weeks; energy effects may be acute to 1 week"
duration: "Ongoing with consistent use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Macamides inhibit fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), elevating endocannabinoids; glucosinolates converted to isothiocyanates; monoamine modulation"

dosing:
  min: 1500
  typical: 3000
  max: 5000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "Gelatinized form better absorbed than raw. Yellow for general use; black for cognition; red for prostate/bone. Take with food."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_discomfort
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Raw maca more likely to cause bloating; gelatinized form reduces this significantly"
  - name: thyroid_concern
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Contains glucosinolates which are goitrogens; theoretical concern at very high doses; cooking/gelatinization reduces this"

interactions:
  - target: ashwagandha
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary libido and stress-resilience combination; ashwagandha reduces cortisol-mediated testosterone suppression while maca independently drives libido"
  - target: tongkat-ali
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Common libido and male performance stack; tongkat-ali has stronger testosterone evidence, maca has stronger libido-specific evidence"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: FAAH_inhibition
    description: "Macamides (unique benzylamine-fatty acid conjugates) inhibit fatty acid amide hydrolase, elevating anandamide and other endocannabinoids"
  - pathway: monoamine_modulation
    description: "Supports dopamine and serotonin balance in hypothalamic areas regulating libido and mood"
  - pathway: glucosinolate_metabolism
    description: "Benzyl glucosinolates converted to benzyl isothiocyanate; antiproliferative effects; hormonal modulation via aromatase inhibition"
