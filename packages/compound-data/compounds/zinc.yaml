  Zinc is an essential trace mineral involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions and critical
  to immune function, testosterone production, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cognitive
  function. It is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies globally, particularly
  in men with poor dietary variety, heavy athletes who lose zinc in sweat, and vegetarians.
  Even mild zinc deficiency significantly reduces testosterone levels — supplementation
  in deficient men can increase testosterone 40-100%. Forms vary in bioavailability:
  bisglycinate and picolinate > citrate > gluconate > oxide.

halfLife: "Plasma zinc: ~2-3 hours; tissue zinc: weeks to months"
onset: "Immune effects days; testosterone recovery 4-12 weeks in deficient individuals"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Cofactor for >300 enzymes; 5α-reductase and aromatase inhibition; androgen receptor signaling; thymulin production for T-cell maturation"

dosing:
  min: 15
  typical: 30
  max: 50
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "Take on empty stomach or with small meal (not with high-phytate foods like whole grains/legumes which block absorption). Picolinate or bisglycinate preferred. Do not exceed 40mg elemental zinc long-term — competes with copper absorption."

sideEffects:
  - name: nausea
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most common side effect; take with small amount of food or use lower-irritation form (bisglycinate)"
  - name: copper_depletion
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "High-dose zinc (>40mg/day) chronically depletes copper; supplement with 1-2mg copper if taking >30mg zinc daily"
  - name: GI_irritation
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Particularly with zinc sulfate; switch to chelated form"

interactions:
  - target: magnesium-glycinate
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "ZMA (zinc + magnesium + B6) is a classic combination for testosterone support and sleep quality; take together at night"
  - target: vitamin-d3
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both required for testosterone synthesis and immune function; zinc deficiency impairs vitamin D receptor signaling"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: testosterone_synthesis
    description: "Required for LH receptor signaling and Leydig cell steroidogenesis; inhibits aromatase, reducing testosterone-to-estrogen conversion"
  - pathway: immune_function
    description: "Required for thymulin (thymic hormone for T-cell maturation); zinc-finger proteins regulate immune gene transcription"
  - pathway: antioxidant

  - pathway: protein_synthesis
    description: "Required for ribosomal RNA polymerase activity; essential for all protein synthesis"
