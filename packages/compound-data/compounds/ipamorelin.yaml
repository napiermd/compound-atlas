# Ipamorelin — Selective GHRP peptide
slug: ipamorelin
name: Ipamorelin
aliases:
  - NNC 26-0161
  - ipamorelin acetate
category: PEPTIDE
subcategory: GHRP
legalStatus: GRAY_MARKET
clinicalPhase: "No formal trials"
description: |
  Ipamorelin is a pentapeptide growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP) that selectively
  stimulates GH release with minimal effect on cortisol, prolactin, or appetite —
  distinguishing it from GHRP-2 and GHRP-6. Works by mimicking ghrelin at GHS-R1a
  receptors. Typically combined with a GHRH analog (CJC-1295) for synergistic GH pulses.
  The cleanest GHRP available, making it preferred for long-term anti-aging and recovery
  protocols.

halfLife: "~2 hours"
onset: "15–30 minutes (GH pulse)"
duration: "GH pulse 2–3 hours post-injection"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "Ghrelin mimetic at GHS-R1a receptors; amplifies GH pulse without raising cortisol or prolactin"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 300
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "2–3x/day, fasted (AM, pre-workout, before bed)"
  notes: "Inject 15–30 min before bed for maximum GH pulse during slow-wave sleep. Avoid carbs/fat 1h before injection. Combine with CJC-1295 for synergy."

sideEffects:
  - name: water_retention
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Significantly less than GHRP-2 or GHRP-6"
  - name: injection_site_reaction
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Redness, brief soreness; rotate sites"
  - name: mild_hunger
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Less pronounced than GHRP-6; ghrelin-like appetite effects are attenuated"

interactions:
  - target: cjc-1295
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Ipamorelin (GHRP) + CJC-1295 (GHRH) is the gold standard peptide stack. Together produce 4–10x greater GH release than either alone."
  - target: mk-677
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both act on GHS-R1a; additive GH and IGF-1 effects with possible receptor saturation at maximum doses"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: GHS_R1a_agonism
    description: "Binds ghrelin/GHS-R1a receptors on pituitary somatotrophs, triggering calcium-dependent GH exocytosis"
  - pathway: somatostatin_suppression
    description: "Transiently reduces somatostatin tone, allowing larger GH pulses"
  - pathway: selective_GH_release
    description: "Unlike GHRP-2/6, does not activate ACTH/cortisol or prolactin pathways"
