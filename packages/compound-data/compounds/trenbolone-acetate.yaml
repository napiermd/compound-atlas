description: |
  Trenbolone Acetate is a veterinary-grade 19-nortestosterone derivative approved for cattle
  muscle growth (Finaplix-H implants). It is considered the most powerful anabolic steroid
  used by bodybuilders. With an anabolic:androgenic ratio of ~500:500 vs testosterone's
  100:100, it produces dramatic lean mass and strength gains with potent fat loss simultaneously —
  the only compound that achieves true recomposition at high doses. It does not aromatize to
  estrogen but binds progesterone receptors. Its side effect profile is among the harshest
  of any AAS: cardiovascular, neurological, androgenic, and mental health effects.
  NOT for beginners. Scheduled III controlled substance in the US; no human medical use.

halfLife: "~3 days (acetate ester)"
onset: "Strength and vascularity improvements 1-2 weeks; muscle growth 4-6 weeks"
duration: "Rapid clearance with acetate ester; detectable on drug test for months"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular_injection
mechanismShort: "Highly potent AR agonist (5x testosterone affinity); direct IGF-1 upregulation; glucocorticoid receptor competition; does not aromatize; progestogenic activity"

dosing:
  min: 150
  typical: 300
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "every other day (EOD) due to short half-life"
  notes: "Advanced users only. Start at 150-200mg/week to assess individual response before increasing. EOD injections for stable blood levels. No AI needed (non-aromatizing) but may need prolactin control. Stack with testosterone base."

sideEffects:
  - name: cardiovascular
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most significant concern: LVH, reduced cardiac output, severe HDL reduction, hypertension; cardiac monitoring essential"
  - name: androgenic
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "Severe acne, hair loss, aggression ('tren rage'), libido dysregulation; extremely harsh androgenic side effects"
  - name: tren_cough
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Immediate post-injection bronchospasm from oil entering vascular bed; usually resolves seconds to minutes"
  - name: night_sweats
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Profuse night sweating; nearly universal at effective doses"
  - name: insomnia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Stimulant-adjacent CNS effects; sleep quality typically impaired"
  - name: mental_health
    severity: severe
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Anxiety, paranoia, depression; neurosteroid effects on CNS; psychiatric history is relative contraindication"

interactions:
  - target: testosterone-cypionate
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Testosterone base is essential when using tren to maintain libido and prevent progesterone-related sexual dysfunction; always use tren with testosterone"
  - target: anastrozole
    type: neutral
    severity: mild
    description: "Tren doesn't aromatize; AI not needed for tren itself, but needed if stacking with aromatizing compounds"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: androgen_receptor_high_affinity
    description: "Binds AR with 5x higher affinity than testosterone and does not undergo 5α-reduction; cannot be aromatized; potent AR activation in all tissues"
  - pathway: IGF_1_upregulation
    description: "Directly stimulates IGF-1 mRNA expression in muscle independent of GH; potent muscle hypertrophy signal"
  - pathway: glucocorticoid_competition
    description: "High glucocorticoid receptor affinity; strongly anti-catabolic — preserves and builds muscle even in caloric deficits"
  - pathway: progestogenic_activity
    description: "Binds progesterone receptor; may contribute to libido, mood, and sexual side effects when testosterone is not included"
