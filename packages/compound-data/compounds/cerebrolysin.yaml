description: |
  Cerebrolysin is a standardized porcine brain-derived peptide mixture containing low
  molecular weight neuropeptides and amino acids. Widely used in Eastern Europe, China,
  and Latin America for stroke recovery, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease,
  and vascular dementia — with regulatory approval in many countries outside the US/UK.
  Phase III trials have been conducted for acute ischemic stroke (CASTA trial) with
  mixed but generally positive results. Mechanism involves neurotrophic factor-like
  activity mimicking BDNF and NGF, promoting neuronal survival, dendritic sprouting,
  and neuroplasticity. Injectable only (IV/IM). Gray-market in the US — not FDA approved
  but widely imported. Legitimate clinical use context in stroke neurology.

halfLife: "Unknown (peptide mixture with variable components)"
onset: "IV: effects within 1–2 weeks of treatment course; IM similar but slower"
duration: "Benefits from treatment courses may persist weeks to months"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intravenous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "Porcine brain peptide mixture with neurotrophic factor-like activity; activates BDNF/NGF signaling pathways; promotes neuroplasticity, neuronal survival, and synaptogenesis"

dosing:
  min: 5
  typical: 20
  max: 60
  unit: ml
  frequency: "IV infusion or IM injection, typically in 10–20 day courses"
  notes: "Clinical protocols: 10–30mL IV for 10–20 days (stroke). Cognitive enhancement community: 5–10mL IM per injection, 10-day courses. Must be injectable formulation. Repeat courses every 3–6 months."
