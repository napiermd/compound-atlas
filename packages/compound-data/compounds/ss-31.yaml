description: |
  SS-31 (elamipretide) is a water-soluble aromatic-cationic tetrapeptide that selectively
  targets the inner mitochondrial membrane via cardiolipin interaction. It stabilizes
  mitochondrial cristae structure, reduces ROS production, and restores ATP synthesis
  efficiency in damaged mitochondria. Phase II and III trials are ongoing for heart
  failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), Barth syndrome, and age-associated
  frailty. Has demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac
  function in multiple RCTs.

halfLife: "~2.6 hours (plasma)"
onset: "Acute: 30–60 minutes; Clinical: weeks to months"
duration: "Requires ongoing treatment for sustained benefits"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Selectively partitions to inner mitochondrial membrane via cardiolipin binding; stabilizes cristae, reduces ROS, and restores ATP production efficiency"

dosing:
  min: 4
  typical: 40
