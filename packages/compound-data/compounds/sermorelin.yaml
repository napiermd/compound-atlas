# Sermorelin — GHRH analog; GH stimulation, body composition, sleep
slug: sermorelin
name: Sermorelin
aliases:

  - Geref
  - sermorelin acetate
category: GH_SECRETAGOGUE
subcategory: GHRH_analog
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Sermorelin is a synthetic analog of the first 29 amino acids of growth hormone releasing
  hormone (GHRH 1-29). Unlike HGH, it stimulates the pituitary to produce GH in a pulsatile,
  physiological manner rather than delivering exogenous GH. FDA-approved for pediatric GH
  deficiency diagnosis and treatment; widely prescribed off-label by anti-aging and longevity
  physicians. Advantages over exogenous HGH: preserves pituitary function, more physiological
  GH pulses, lower feedback suppression, significantly lower cost. Often combined with GHRP-2
  or ipamorelin to maximize GH pulse amplitude via dual-axis stimulation.

halfLife: "~11-12 minutes (plasma)"
onset: "GH elevation within 15-30 minutes of injection; body composition changes 3-6 months"
duration: "Single dose GH pulse 1-2 hours; cumulative effects require months"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "GHRH receptor agonist in anterior pituitary somatotrophs; increases cAMP via Gs-coupled receptor; amplifies pulsatile GH release; preserves hypothalamic-pituitary axis"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 300
  max: 500
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "daily (bedtime)"
  notes: "Inject SC at bedtime on empty stomach (no food 2h before) to maximize natural GH pulse. Combine with GHRP-2 or ipamorelin for synergistic GH amplification. Reconstitute in bacteriostatic water. Must be kept refrigerated."

sideEffects:
  - name: flushing
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Transient facial flushing within minutes of injection; harmless"
  - name: injection_site_reaction
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild erythema; rotate injection sites"
  - name: water_retention
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild edema; dose-dependent; less than exogenous HGH"
  - name: cortisol_increase
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "GH stimulates cortisol; monitor if already high-cortisol state"

interactions:
  - target: ipamorelin
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Classic dual-axis combination: sermorelin stimulates pituitary via GHRH receptor (Gs/cAMP), ipamorelin acts via ghrelin receptor — together produce supra-additive GH pulse vs either alone"
  - target: mk-677
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Both stimulate GH; sermorelin via GHRH axis, MK-677 via ghrelin receptor (oral). Sermorelin provides natural pulse, MK-677 provides sustained 24h elevation — powerful but monitor IGF-1"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: GHRH_receptor_agonism
    description: "Binds GHRH receptor on somatotrophs in anterior pituitary; activates Gs protein, increases cAMP, stimulates pulsatile GH release"
  - pathway: somatotroph_sensitization
    description: "Increases pituitary somatotroph responsiveness over time; unlike exogenous GH which suppresses axis, sermorelin can restore natural GH secretion capacity"
  - pathway: IGF_1_elevation
    description: "GH stimulates hepatic IGF-1 production; most anabolic and body composition effects mediated via IGF-1"
