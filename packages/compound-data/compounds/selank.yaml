  Selank is a synthetic heptapeptide (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro) analog of tuftsin developed
  by the Institute of Molecular Genetics in Moscow. It combines anxiolytic effects without
  sedation or dependence with immune modulation and mild cognitive enhancement. In Russian
  clinical trials it performed comparably to benzodiazepines for generalized anxiety disorder
  with superior cognitive profile (no impairment), no dependence, and without withdrawal.
  Pairs naturally with Semax (stimulating/activating) as Selank provides the anxiolytic/calming
  component. Used for generalized anxiety, PTSD, and as a cognitive enhancer under stress.

halfLife: "~2-3 minutes (plasma); effects persist hours via receptor changes"
onset: "Anxiolytic effects within 15-30 minutes intranasally"
duration: "Acute effects 4-8 hours; anxiolytic benefits build over weeks"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intranasal
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "Enkephalinase inhibition increases endogenous enkephalins; GABA-A modulation without direct binding; BDNF induction; IL-6/interferon modulation; serotonin normalization"

dosing:
  min: 250
  typical: 750
  max: 3000
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1-3x/day"
  notes: "Intranasal administration. 0.15% concentration is common. For anxiety: 250-500mcg 2-3x/day. Cycle similarly to Semax. Can be used daily long-term with lower dependence risk than anxiolytics."

sideEffects:
  - name: fatigue
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Sedation is far less than benzos; some report mild tiredness, especially at first"
  - name: nasal_irritation
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Route-related; minor and transient"
  - name: increased_appetite
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Via opioid/enkephalin pathway; monitor caloric intake"

interactions:
  - target: semax
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary pair: semax provides stimulating BDNF/dopaminergic activation, selank provides anxiolytic GABAergic/enkephalin balance — the 'accelerator and brake'"
  - target: ashwagandha
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both reduce anxiety via distinct mechanisms; selank acute (enkephalin/GABA), ashwagandha chronic (HPA/cortisol) — good combination for comprehensive anxiety management"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: enkephalinase_inhibition
    description: "Inhibits enzymes that degrade endogenous enkephalins and endorphins, increasing endogenous opioid peptide tone"
  - pathway: GABA_modulation
    description: "Modulates GABAergic transmission and benzodiazepine receptor without direct binding; anxiolytic without dependence liability"
  - pathway: BDNF_induction
    description: "Increases BDNF in hippocampus (weaker effect than semax); supports neuroplasticity and stress resilience"
  - pathway: immune_regulation
    description: "Derived from tuftsin (immune tetrapeptide); modulates IL-6, interferon-gamma, and macrophage activation"
  - pathway: serotonin_normalization
    description: "Normalizes serotonin metabolism in limbic regions; contributes to anxiolytic and mood-stabilizing effects"
