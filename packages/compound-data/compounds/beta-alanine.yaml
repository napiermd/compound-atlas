description: |
  Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid and the rate-limiting precursor to carnosine,
  a dipeptide (beta-alanine + histidine) concentrated in skeletal muscle. Carnosine acts
  as an intramuscular pH buffer, absorbing hydrogen ions generated during high-intensity
  glycolytic exercise. Beta-alanine supplementation elevates muscle carnosine by 40-80%
  over 4-8 weeks, consistently improving performance in exercise bouts lasting 1-4 minutes.
  Over 40 clinical studies support its efficacy.

halfLife: "~25 minutes (plasma); carnosine elevation persists for weeks after cessation"
onset: "4-8 weeks for significant carnosine loading and performance benefit"
duration: "Carnosine remains elevated 6-8 weeks after stopping; reloading faster on second cycle"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Rate-limiting carnosine precursor; muscle carnosine buffers intramuscular H+ ions during high-intensity glycolytic activity"

dosing:
  min: 2400
  typical: 3200
  max: 6400
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily in divided doses"
  notes: "Split into 800-1600mg doses to minimize paresthesia. Sustained-release form (CarnoSyn SR) further reduces tingling. Take consistently daily for loading."

sideEffects:
  - name: paresthesia
    severity: mild
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Harmless skin tingling/flushing beginning 15-20 min post-dose, lasting 60-90 min. Dose-dependent and benign. Use SR formulation or split doses to minimize."

interactions:
  - target: creatine-monohydrate
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary performance mechanisms: creatine supports rapid ATP resynthesis (0-10 sec efforts), beta-alanine buffers pH (60-240 sec efforts)"
  - target: citrulline-malate
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Citrulline improves blood flow and reduces ammonia-driven fatigue; beta-alanine buffers lactic acid; together address multiple fatigue pathways"
