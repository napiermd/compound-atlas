description: |
  Stanozolol is a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-derived anabolic steroid available in oral
  and injectable forms, famous for the 1988 Ben Johnson Olympic sprint doping scandal.
  FDA-approved historically for angioedema (hereditary HAE) and anemia; approved use is
  now limited. Its primary characteristics: strong SHBG binding displacement (raises free
  testosterone dramatically), minimal water retention ("dry" gains), significant strength
  relative to mass gain, and hepatotoxicity with oral use. Popular in cutting protocols for
  definition and strength without adding water weight. Injectable form (Winstrol Depot)
  is water-based rather than oil-based.

halfLife: "Oral: ~9 hours; Injectable: ~24 hours"
onset: "Strength improvements within 2-3 weeks; physique changes 4-6 weeks"
duration: "Oral detectable ~3 weeks; injectable ~9 weeks in drug testing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - intramuscular_injection
mechanismShort: "AR agonist with DHT backbone; potent SHBG competitor; displaces testosterone from SHBG increasing free T; C17-alpha alkylated (oral) for oral bioavailability causing hepatotoxicity"

dosing:
  min: 20
  typical: 50
  max: 100
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (oral) or every other day (injectable)"
  notes: "Oral: 25-50mg/day. Injectable: 50mg EOD. Limit cycles to 6-8 weeks due to hepatotoxicity risk with oral form. Monitor liver enzymes (AST, ALT) weekly to biweekly during oral use. Run with testosterone base."

sideEffects:
  - name: hepatotoxicity
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "C17-alpha alkylation causes significant hepatotoxicity with oral use; liver enzyme elevation expected; use TUDCA/UDCA, limit cycle length, avoid alcohol"
  - name: joint_dryness
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Reduces water in joint synovial fluid — joint pain, particularly shoulders and knees; glucosamine/chondroitin and collagen supplementation recommended"
  - name: lipid_changes
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "Dramatic HDL reduction (worst of any AAS); cardiovascular risk monitoring essential"
  - name: androgenic_effects
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Hair loss, acne; DHT-derived — affects androgen-sensitive tissues strongly"

interactions:
  - target: testosterone-enanthate
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate

    description: "NAC provides hepatoprotection via glutathione pathway during oral stanozolol use; TUDCA adds additional liver protection"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: SHBG_displacement
    description: "Potent SHBG competitor; binds SHBG with high affinity, displacing testosterone and increasing free testosterone fraction in blood by 20-40%"
  - pathway: androgen_receptor_agonism
    description: "DHT-derived AR agonist; activates AR in muscle, bone, and androgenic tissues without ability to be aromatized to estrogen"
  - pathway: C17_alkylation_metabolism
    description: "C17-alpha alkylation allows oral bioavailability but creates hepatotoxic metabolites via first-pass liver metabolism"
