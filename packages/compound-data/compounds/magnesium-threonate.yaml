  Magnesium L-Threonate is a novel form of magnesium developed at MIT specifically for its
  ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and increase brain magnesium levels — something
  other forms (glycinate, citrate, oxide) do poorly. Animal studies showed significant
  improvements in synaptic density, LTP (long-term potentiation), working memory, and
  cognitive aging reversal. Human RCTs in older adults with cognitive impairment showed
  significant improvements in executive function and attention. Distinct from magnesium
  glycinate: MgT for brain, glycinate for sleep/anxiety/muscle. Often combined.

halfLife: "~2 hours (plasma); brain elevation persists 12-24 hours"
onset: "Subjective sleep improvement: 1-2 weeks; cognitive effects: 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with consistent dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Uniquely elevates cerebrospinal fluid and synaptic magnesium; increases synaptic density via NMDA receptor modulation; activates PKA/PKC signaling for synaptic plasticity"

dosing:
  min: 1000
  typical: 2000
  max: 2000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "Magtein brand is the studied form. 2g Magtein = ~144mg elemental magnesium. Take before bed. Combine with magnesium glycinate for broader coverage (sleep/anxiety + brain)."

sideEffects:
  - name: loose_stools
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Less laxative effect than oxide or citrate; well tolerated"
  - name: drowsiness
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Beneficial for bedtime use; avoid if taken during day for cognitive work"

interactions:
  - target: magnesium-glycinate
    type: neutral
    severity: mild
    description: "Can combine: glycinate for sleep/anxiety/muscle (higher elemental Mg), threonate for brain/cognition — complementary not redundant"
  - target: lions-mane
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Additive neuroplasticity support: MgT increases synaptic density, lion's mane drives NGF-mediated neurogenesis"
