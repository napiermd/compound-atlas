clinicalPhase: "Phase I"
description: |
  RAD-140 (Testolone) is a highly potent oral SARM originally developed by Radius Health
  for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Phase I completed in breast cancer patients.
  In animal models it demonstrated near-anabolic-steroid-equivalent muscle growth with
  brain-protective (neuroprotective) effects via AR activation in neural tissue. Among the
  most potent SARMs by milligram. Significant testosterone suppression, liver toxicity cases
  reported. WADA-prohibited.

halfLife: "~60 hours"
onset: "2–3 weeks for strength; 6–8 weeks for body composition changes"
duration: "Long suppression recovery: 6–10 weeks"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Potent selective AR agonist; high muscle:prostate anabolic ratio; also activates neuroprotective AR pathways in brain"

dosing:
  min: 5
  typical: 10
  max: 20
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral"
  notes: "Long half-life means once-daily dosing is ideal. Fitness community uses 5–20mg for 8–12 weeks. Requires PCT. Start low due to high potency."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Significant suppression at 10mg+; PCT with SERMs mandatory"
  - name: hepatotoxicity
    severity: severe
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Case reports of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) including cholestatic hepatitis. Monitor LFTs."

    notes: "From androgenic activity; more pronounced than ostarine"

    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "HDL reduction; cardiovascular risk with long-term use"
