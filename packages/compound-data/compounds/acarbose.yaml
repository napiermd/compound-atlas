description: |
  Acarbose is an FDA-approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitor for type 2 diabetes that delays
  carbohydrate digestion and blunts postprandial glucose spikes. It has become notable in
  longevity research through the NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP), where it extended
  median lifespan in mice by 22% in males and 5% in females — one of the top-performing
  compounds in the most rigorous aging intervention program in existence. The mechanism
  is distinct from metformin: acarbose blunts glucose peaks (reducing glycemic variability
  and AGE formation) rather than activating AMPK. It also modifies the gut microbiome to
  favor Bacteroidetes and short-chain fatty acid producers. Often used in combination with
  metformin in longevity protocols.

halfLife: "~2 hours (very low systemic absorption; acts locally in gut)"
onset: "Glucose blunting immediate (with meals); microbiome changes weeks; longevity effects chronic"
duration: "Taken with each carbohydrate-containing meal for effect"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Competitive inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic alpha-amylase in small intestine; delays breakdown of complex carbs to glucose; reduces postprandial glucose spike by 30-50%; modifies gut microbiome"

dosing:
  min: 25
  typical: 100
  max: 300
  unit: mg
  frequency: "3x/day with first bite of each meal"
  notes: "Must be taken with the first bite of food for effect. Start at 25mg 3x/day and titrate over 4-8 weeks to minimize GI side effects. Take with carbohydrate-containing meals only — no effect if no carbs."

sideEffects:
  - name: flatulence_bloating
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most common side effect (50-70% of users); from undigested carbs reaching colonic bacteria. Usually improves significantly after 4-8 weeks as microbiome adapts. Start low and titrate."
  - name: diarrhea
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Especially early in treatment; osmotic effect of unabsorbed carbs; resolves with continued use"
  - name: hypoglycemia_risk
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Alone, cannot cause hypoglycemia (requires insulin secretion). Risk if combined with sulfonylureas or insulin — treat with glucose not sucrose (which requires glucosidase)"

interactions:
  - target: metformin
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Complementary longevity combination: metformin activates AMPK and modifies microbiome, acarbose blunts glucose spikes and modifies microbiome differently — ITP data suggests additive benefit"
  - target: berberine
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both reduce glucose absorption and improve insulin sensitivity via different mechanisms; additive glycemic control with complementary microbiome effects"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: alpha_glucosidase_inhibition
    description: "Competitive inhibition of intestinal alpha-glucosidase brush border enzymes that cleave oligosaccharides and disaccharides; delays monosaccharide absorption"
  - pathway: amylase_inhibition
    description: "Inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase, reducing starch breakdown in gut lumen; blunts both the rate and peak of glucose absorption from complex carbohydrates"
  - pathway: microbiome_modification
    description: "Undigested carbs reaching colon serve as prebiotic substrate; increases Bacteroidetes and short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus)"
  - pathway: AGE_reduction
    description: "By reducing postprandial glucose peaks, reduces non-enzymatic glycation of proteins and AGE (advanced glycation end product) formation — key aging mechanism"
