description: |
  Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in plants including Berberis and goldenseal.
  Extensive clinical trial data (primarily from China) demonstrates efficacy comparable
  to metformin for type 2 diabetes blood glucose control. Activates AMPK — the primary
  cellular energy sensor — driving downstream effects on glucose metabolism, lipid
  metabolism, and inflammation. Also improves lipid profiles (LDL-C reduction comparable
  to low-dose statins in some studies). Increasingly recognized as a legitimate metabolic
  therapeutic. Used for blood glucose management, weight loss, PCOS, and cardiovascular
  risk reduction. Bioavailability is poor (5–20%) but active, and can be improved with
  lipid formulations. Generally well-tolerated.

halfLife: "~4–6 hours"
onset: "Blood glucose effects within days; lipid effects over 4–8 weeks"
duration: "Effects active during dosing; benefits may partially persist"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "AMPK activator; inhibits complex I of mitochondrial respiratory chain (similar to metformin); reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis; activates GLUT4 translocation; reduces intestinal glucose absorption"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1000
  max: 1500
  unit: mg
  frequency: "500mg 2–3x daily with meals"
  notes: "1,500mg/day in divided doses with meals is most studied. Poor bioavailability — take with meals. Berberine phytosome formulations (Berbevis) have 10x better absorption. Cyclic use (8 weeks on, 4 weeks off) recommended by some to prevent tolerance."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_upset
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Nausea, cramping, constipation, or diarrhea, especially early in use; dose with food, start low and titrate up"
  - name: hypoglycemia_risk
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Can lower blood glucose significantly; caution with other blood sugar-lowering medications. Monitor glucose."
  - name: drug_interactions
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor; affects metabolism of many medications. Check interactions with all current medications."

interactions:
  - target: semaglutide
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Additive blood glucose lowering and weight effects; monitor for hypoglycemia with combined use"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: AMPK_activation
    description: "Activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I; AMPK activation drives glucose uptake, fat oxidation, and reduced gluconeogenesis"
  - pathway: GLUT4_translocation
    description: "Promotes GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation to cell surface; increases peripheral glucose uptake independent of insulin"
  - pathway: hepatic_gluconeogenesis_inhibition
    description: "Reduces hepatic glucose output by inhibiting gluconeogenic enzymes; mechanism similar to metformin"
  - pathway: gut_microbiome_modulation
    description: "Modifies gut microbiome composition; reduces Firmicutes, increases Bacteroidetes; partially mediates metabolic effects"
