slug: modafinil
name: Modafinil

category: NOOTROPIC
subcategory: eugeroic
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Modafinil is a Schedule IV wakefulness-promoting agent FDA-approved for narcolepsy,
  shift work sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. Off-label it is widely used
  as a cognitive enhancer for focus, working memory, and sustained wakefulness. Unlike
  amphetamines, it has minimal cardiovascular side effects, low addiction potential, and
  a more targeted mechanism. Evidence for cognitive enhancement in healthy adults is mixed
  but reasonably consistent for tasks requiring sustained attention.

halfLife: "12-15 hours"
onset: "30-60 minutes"
duration: "8-12 hours of wakefulness promotion"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Weak DAT inhibition raises synaptic dopamine; activates orexin/hypocretin neurons; increases histamine and NE"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 400
  unit: mg
  frequency: "once daily, morning"
  notes: "Take before noon to prevent insomnia. 100mg is effective and better tolerated for many users. Food delays but does not reduce absorption."

sideEffects:
  - name: insomnia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Dose-dependent; take before noon; half-life of 12-15h precludes afternoon dosing"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Commonly from dehydration; ensure 2-3L water intake on modafinil days"
  - name: reduced_appetite
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Schedule meals proactively; does not impair absorption of nutrients when eaten"
  - name: anxiety
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "More likely at 200-400mg; L-theanine 200mg may attenuate without reducing wakefulness"
  - name: Stevens_Johnson_syndrome
    severity: severe
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Rare but serious dermatological reaction; discontinue immediately at any skin rash"

interactions:
  - target: l-theanine
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "L-theanine reduces modafinil-associated anxiety and jitteriness while preserving wakefulness benefits"
  - target: alpha-gpc
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Alpha-GPC may enhance modafinil's cognitive effects; acetylcholine support complements dopaminergic mechanism"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: dopamine_reuptake_inhibition
    description: "Weak, non-releasing DAT inhibitor; increases synaptic dopamine primarily in striatum and nucleus accumbens without amphetamine-like releasing activity"
  - pathway: orexin_activation
    description: "Activates hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons that regulate wakefulness, appetite, and arousal"
  - pathway: norepinephrine_modulation
    description: "Inhibits norepinephrine reuptake in the locus coeruleus, promoting alertness and vigilance"
  - pathway: histamine_release
    description: "Increases hypothalamic histamine release downstream of orexin activation, promoting wakefulness via H1 receptors"
