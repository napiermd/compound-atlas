description: |
  Nandrolone Decanoate (Deca-Durabolin) is one of the most widely prescribed anabolic
  steroids medically, FDA-approved for anemia (increases EPO and erythropoiesis), breast
  cancer, and osteoporosis. It is a 19-nortestosterone derivative with a favorable side
  effect profile compared to testosterone in several respects — lower DHT conversion (converts
  to weak dihydronandrolone), lower androgenic side effects, less hair loss. However, it
  has significant progestogenic activity and causes "Deca dick" (erectile dysfunction) via
  dopaminergic suppression if not combined with adequate testosterone. Famous for joint
  lubrication effects (increased synovial fluid and collagen synthesis). Long half-life
  (6-12 days) requires patience with dosing.

halfLife: "~6-12 days"
onset: "Joint relief 2-4 weeks; anabolic effects 4-8 weeks; full effects 12+ weeks"
duration: "Very long-acting; detectable on drug tests up to 18+ months"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular_injection
mechanismShort: "AR agonist with lower DHT conversion; progestogen receptor agonism; increases collagen synthesis (II and III); stimulates EPO; IGF-1 upregulation; glucocorticoid antagonism"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "weekly or twice weekly"
  notes: "MUST run with testosterone base (1:2 or 1:1 test:deca ratio minimum) to prevent libido/erectile dysfunction. 300-400mg/week is a common therapeutic/performance dose. Allow 12+ weeks for full benefit. Prolactin management (cabergoline) may be needed."

sideEffects:
  - name: erectile_dysfunction
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "'Deca dick' — progestogenic suppression of dopamine reduces libido/erectile function when not paired with adequate testosterone; always use testosterone base"
  - name: HPG_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: certain
    notes: "Very long half-life means HPG suppression persists for months post-cycle; recovery takes longer than testosterone; PCT timing must account for this"
  - name: prolactin_elevation
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Progestogenic nandrolone can elevate prolactin; cabergoline 0.25-0.5mg twice weekly if needed"
  - name: cardiovascular
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "HDL reduction, LVH; lower risk than trenbolone but significant with chronic use"

interactions:
  - target: testosterone-enanthate
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Mandatory combination: testosterone provides dopaminergic support for libido/erections while nandrolone provides anabolic and joint benefits — classic mass-building combination"
  - target: bpc-157
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both support connective tissue; deca increases collagen synthesis systemically, BPC-157 accelerates local tendon/ligament repair — injury prevention and recovery stack"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: androgen_receptor_agonism
    description: "Binds AR with moderate affinity; 5α-reductase converts nandrolone to dihydronandrolone (weak AR agonist, unlike potent DHT from testosterone) — lower androgenic side effects"
  - pathway: collagen_synthesis
    description: "Increases type I, II, and III collagen synthesis in tendons, ligaments, and cartilage; mechanism for joint lubrication and pain reduction"
  - pathway: erythropoiesis
    description: "Stimulates EPO production in kidneys and direct bone marrow effects; increases red blood cell production — basis for anemia indication"
  - pathway: progestogenic_activity
    description: "Binds progesterone receptor with moderate affinity; contributes to libido suppression, potential prolactin elevation"
