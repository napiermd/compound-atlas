# Ostarine — MK-2866, most studied SARM
slug: ostarine
name: Ostarine

category: SARM

legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
clinicalPhase: "Phase II"
description: |
  Ostarine (MK-2866, Enobosarm) is the most clinically studied SARM. Phase II trials
  completed for cancer cachexia showed significant lean mass gains and improved physical
  function at 1–3mg/day. Phase III was initiated but not completed. Despite trial history,
  it remains unapproved. Used widely in the research and fitness communities for muscle
  preservation, recomposition, and joint support. Suppresses endogenous testosterone in a
  dose- and duration-dependent manner. WADA-prohibited.

halfLife: "~24 hours"
onset: "2–3 weeks for noticeable muscle effects"
duration: "Effects persist weeks; suppression recovers over 4–6 weeks post-cycle"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Selective AR agonist with tissue selectivity for muscle and bone over prostate and sebaceous glands; anabolic without full androgenic activity"

dosing:
  min: 10
  typical: 20
  max: 30
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral"
  notes: "Research doses: 1–3mg/day (clinical). Fitness community: 10–30mg/day 8–12 weeks. PCT may be warranted at higher doses/longer cycles. WADA prohibited."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Dose and duration-dependent; 20–30mg for 8–12 weeks causes significant suppression requiring post-cycle therapy"

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild ALT/AST elevations at higher doses; monitor LFTs"

    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Reduces HDL cholesterol; larger impact with oral SARMs vs. injectable androgens"
  - name: vision_disturbances
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Yellow-tinted vision (Ostarine vision) reported; cause unclear; discontinue if persistent"

interactions:
  - target: lgd-4033
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Often stacked for recomposition; additive anabolic effects but significantly more suppression. Requires robust PCT."
