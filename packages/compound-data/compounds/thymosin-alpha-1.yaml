description: |
  Thymosin Alpha-1 (Tα1) is a naturally occurring 28-amino acid peptide derived from thymosin
  fraction 5 of the thymus gland. It is FDA-approved in the US as an orphan drug and approved
  in 35+ countries (as Zadaxin) for chronic hepatitis B and C, cancer immunotherapy adjunct,
  DiGeorge syndrome, and severe sepsis. It is a potent thymic hormone that matures naive
  T-cells, enhances NK cell activity, and restores immune competence in immunocompromised
  states. Growing use in biohacking/longevity communities for immune optimization, chronic
  infections, and post-viral syndromes (Long COVID). Extraordinarily safe profile across
  decades of clinical use.

halfLife: "~2 hours"
onset: "Immunological effects within days to weeks; clinical outcomes 4-12 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with continued dosing; effects sustained during treatment"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "TLR2/9 agonism activates dendritic cells; T-cell differentiation (Th1 skew) via IL-12/IFN-γ; NK cell maturation; upregulates MHC class I expression on tumor cells"

dosing:
  min: 0.8
  typical: 1.6
  max: 3.2
  unit: mg
  frequency: "2x/week to daily depending on indication"
  notes: "Standard Zadaxin dosing: 1.6mg SC 2x/week. Intensive protocol: 1.6mg daily for acute infections. Reconstitute in provided diluent. Keep refrigerated."

sideEffects:

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild erythema; well tolerated overall"
  - name: flu_like_symptoms
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Occasional with initial dosing due to immune activation; transient"

interactions:
  - target: bpc-157
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "TB-500 + BPC-157 + TA-1 is a comprehensive recovery/immune triple; TA-1 restores immune competence while peptides drive tissue healing"
  - target: tb-500
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both extensively used in injury/recovery protocols; TB-500 drives tissue regeneration, TA-1 ensures immune optimization during healing"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: TLR_agonism
    description: "Activates Toll-like receptors 2 and 9 on dendritic cells and macrophages, initiating innate immune response and antigen presentation"
  - pathway: T_cell_differentiation
    description: "Promotes Th1 differentiation over Th2; increases IL-12 and IFN-γ production; shifts immune balance toward cell-mediated anti-tumor and anti-viral immunity"
  - pathway: NK_cell_maturation
    description: "Enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and proliferation; important for tumor surveillance and viral clearance"
  - pathway: MHC_upregulation
    description: "Increases MHC class I expression on tumor cells, making them visible to cytotoxic T lymphocytes"
