description: |
  BPC-157 is a synthetic pentadecapeptide (15 amino acids) derived from a portion of body
  protection compound found in human gastric juice. It has extensive animal evidence for
  accelerating healing of tendons, ligaments, muscles, gut mucosa, and neurological tissue.
  Human clinical data is limited to GI indications. Widely used by athletes off-label for
  injury recovery and gut healing. Currently research-use only with no approved human
  indications outside gastric ulcer studies.

halfLife: "~4 hours (subcutaneous)"
onset: "Days to weeks depending on injury type and route"
duration: "Effects accumulate over course of use; may persist post-cycle"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous_injection
  - intramuscular_injection
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Upregulates VEGF and GH receptors; activates FAK-paxillin tendon repair pathway; modulates NO-cGMP system"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 600
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Inject near injury site for local effects. Oral dosing (higher dose) may work for gut issues. Reconstitute lyophilized powder in bacteriostatic water."
