# Enclomiphene — Estrogen receptor antagonist; raises LH/FSH/T while preserving fertility
slug: enclomiphene
name: Enclomiphene

category: HORMONAL
subcategory: SERM
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Enclomiphene is the trans-isomer of clomiphene citrate (clomid), isolated from the
  racemic mixture to provide the active estrogen-antagonist component without the estrogenic
  zuclomiphene (cis-) isomer. It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that
  blocks estrogen negative feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary, resulting in increased
  LH and FSH secretion — which stimulates the testes to produce testosterone. Unlike
  exogenous testosterone, it maintains the entire HPG axis and preserves fertility (sperm
  production continues). Phase III trials in secondary hypogonadism showed testosterone
  normalization while preserving semen parameters. Often favored over TRT by younger men
  and those planning families.

halfLife: "~5-7 days"
onset: "LH/FSH increase within days; testosterone normalization 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Testosterone elevation maintained during use; returns toward baseline 4-8 weeks after stopping"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Blocks ER-alpha in hypothalamus and pituitary, reducing estrogen negative feedback; pulsatile GnRH/LH/FSH increase drives testicular testosterone production and spermatogenesis"

dosing:
  min: 12.5
  typical: 25
  max: 50
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "12.5-25mg/day for most men. Titrate based on total testosterone, LH, FSH, and estradiol levels. Monitor every 4-6 weeks initially. No PCT needed after stopping (recovery is intrinsic to mechanism). Do not use in men with active TRT."

sideEffects:
  - name: visual_disturbances
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Blurring, visual flashes; generally reversible but rare cases of persistent vision changes reported with clomiphene; monitor"
  - name: mood_effects
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mood changes (predominantly from zuclomiphene — less of an issue with pure enclomiphene vs. mixed clomid)"
  - name: hot_flashes
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "ER antagonism in thermoregulatory centers; generally mild"
  - name: estrogen_elevation
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Testosterone increase leads to increased aromatization; monitor estradiol and use AI if needed"

interactions:
  - target: anastrozole
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "If elevated testosterone leads to excessive estrogen conversion, anastrozole manages aromatization while enclomiphene continues to drive HPG axis stimulation"
  - target: zinc
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Zinc supports Leydig cell steroidogenesis; complements enclomiphene's LH-driven testosterone production for maximal testicular response"
