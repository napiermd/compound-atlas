description: |
  Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) is the acetylated form of L-carnitine that crosses the
  blood-brain barrier. In the brain it donates its acetyl group for acetylcholine synthesis
  and supports mitochondrial function. It has strong evidence for reversing age-related
  cognitive decline, reducing neuropathic pain, supporting mitochondrial biogenesis, and
  improving fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome. Combined with alpha-lipoic acid it restores
  mitochondrial function in aged animals comparably to young controls. Unlike plain L-carnitine,
  ALCAR has direct nootropic and neuroprotective properties.

halfLife: "~4-5 hours"
onset: "Acute cognitive/energy effects within 1-2 hours; neuroprotective effects weeks to months"
duration: "Ongoing with daily dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Acetyl donor for acetylcholine synthesis; mitochondrial membrane repair; NGF signaling; carnitine palmitoyltransferase support for beta-oxidation"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1500
  max: 3000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Take on empty stomach for better absorption. Morning dosing preferred due to stimulatory effects. Stack with alpha-lipoic acid for synergistic mitochondrial effects."

sideEffects:
  - name: insomnia
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Avoid late afternoon/evening dosing; stimulatory effect interferes with sleep"
  - name: fishy_odor
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Gut bacteria convert some carnitine to TMAO; less pronounced with ALCAR than L-carnitine"
  - name: agitation
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Rare at high doses; reduce dose if restlessness occurs"

interactions:
  - target: alpha-lipoic-acid
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
