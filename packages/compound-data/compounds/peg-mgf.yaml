# PEG-MGF — pegylated mechano growth factor analog
slug: peg-mgf
name: PEG-MGF
aliases:
  - pegylated mechano growth factor
  - PEGylated IGF-1Ec
category: PEPTIDE
subcategory: IGF_variant
legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
clinicalPhase: "Preclinical"
evidenceLevel: D
description: |
  PEG-MGF refers to pegylated variants of mechano growth factor (an IGF-1 splice-related peptide)
  marketed in performance circles for injury recovery and local hypertrophy. Most evidence is
  preclinical, and commercial products often lack batch-level analytical verification.

halfLife: "Variable; pegylation extends native MGF persistence"
onset: "Unknown in humans"
duration: "Likely multi-hour to day-scale depending on construct"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "Experimental IGF-axis splice-variant signaling intended to influence muscle repair pathways"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 400
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "2–4x/week in non-clinical protocols"
  notes: "No standardized or approved human dosing framework."

safetyCaveats:
  - "Human efficacy and safety evidence is sparse and low quality."
  - "Unknown long-term carcinogenic and fibrotic risk profile."
  - "Significant peptide identity/purity uncertainty outside validated labs."
legalCaveats:
  - "Research-only status in most regions; typically not legal for medical marketing."
  - "Likely anti-doping prohibited as a growth factor analog."
