description: |
  Rapamycin (sirolimus) is an FDA-approved immunosuppressant that is also the most
  evidence-backed longevity drug in existence. It is the only drug proven to extend lifespan
  in already-aged mammals — starting at 20 months (equivalent to ~60 human years), mice
  receiving rapamycin showed 9-14% increased maximum lifespan. The mechanism is mTORC1
  inhibition, which mimics dietary restriction. Weekly or biweekly low-dose protocols are
  being studied and used off-label by longevity physicians (Dr. Peter Attia, PEARL trial)
  to avoid the immunosuppressive dose side effects. The PEARL trial is the first placebo-
  controlled longevity trial in healthy humans. Age-related conditions showing benefit include
  declining vaccine immune response reversal, cardiac aging, and physical function.

halfLife: "~62 hours"
onset: "mTOR inhibition within hours; longevity-related effects chronic (months-years)"
duration: "Once-weekly dosing maintains intermittent mTOR inhibition"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "FKBP12 binding → mTORC1 inhibition → reduced protein synthesis, increased autophagy, reduced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), improved lysosomal function"

dosing:
  min: 1
  typical: 5
  max: 10
  unit: mg
  frequency: "once weekly or every 2 weeks (off-label longevity protocol)"
  notes: "REQUIRES physician oversight. Standard longevity protocol: 5-6mg once weekly. Do NOT use immunosuppressive daily dosing (2-5mg/day) for longevity — different risk/benefit. Monitor CBC, lipids, blood glucose. Grapefruit juice increases levels 3-fold."

sideEffects:
  - name: immunosuppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: dose_dependent
    notes: "Daily high-dose: clinically meaningful immunosuppression. Once-weekly 5mg: minimal immunosuppression in longevity protocol. Monitor for infections."
  - name: mucositis
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mouth sores, especially at immunosuppressive doses; rare at longevity doses"
  - name: dyslipidemia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Elevates triglycerides and LDL; monitor lipids every 3-6 months; statin may be needed"
  - name: impaired_wound_healing
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Pause rapamycin 2 weeks before and after surgery"

interactions:
  - target: metformin
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Synergistic longevity combination: rapamycin inhibits mTORC1, metformin activates AMPK — complementary nutrient-sensing pathway inhibition. ITP study showed additive lifespan extension."
  - target: nad-precursors
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both address aging: rapamycin via mTOR/autophagy, NAD+ precursors via sirtuin/PARP. Commonly combined in advanced longevity protocols."

mechanisms:
  - pathway: mTORC1_inhibition
    description: "Forms rapamycin-FKBP12 complex that directly inhibits mTORC1 kinase; reduces ribosomal S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, suppressing protein synthesis and cell growth"
  - pathway: autophagy_induction
    description: "mTORC1 inhibition relieves suppression of ULK1, activating autophagosome formation; one of the most potent autophagy inducers available"
  - pathway: SASP_reduction
    description: "Reduces senescence-associated secretory phenotype by suppressing NF-kB downstream of mTOR; reduces inflammatory cytokine production by senescent cells"
  - pathway: immune_rejuvenation
    description: "Low-dose rapamycin paradoxically improves aged immune function (reverses immunosenescence) at doses below immunosuppressive threshold"
