description: |
  Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound that functions as
  a cofactor for mitochondrial enzyme complexes (PDH, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) and
  as a potent antioxidant that recycles other antioxidants (vitamins C, E, glutathione, CoQ10).
  FDA-approved drug in Germany for diabetic neuropathy (600mg IV or oral). Strong clinical
  evidence for insulin sensitivity improvement, peripheral neuropathy (pain, tingling),
  and mitochondrial function. R-ALA is the biologically active enantiomer with better
  bioavailability than racemic ALA; Na-RALA (sodium R-lipoate) has the highest bioavailability.
  Combined with ALCAR it is one of the most studied mitochondrial restoration combinations.

halfLife: "R-ALA: ~30 minutes (plasma); mitochondrial effects persist longer"
onset: "Glycemic effects acute (1-2 weeks); neuropathy benefits 3-6 months"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Mitochondrial PDH/KGDH cofactor; recycles vitamins C, E, Q10, and glutathione; activates AMPK; Nrf2 induction; inhibits NF-kB; chelates heavy metals"

dosing:
  min: 300
  typical: 600
  max: 1800
  unit: mg
  frequency: "2-3x/day (racemic) or 1-2x/day (R-ALA)"
  notes: "R-ALA: 100-300mg equivalent to 600mg racemic. Na-RALA (stabilized R-ALA) has best absorption. Take 30-60 min before meals for glycemic benefits. Stack with ALCAR for mitochondrial synergy. Avoid high-carb meals immediately after — acute hypoglycemia risk."

sideEffects:
  - name: hypoglycemia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Can lower blood glucose significantly — relevant in diabetics and when combined with glucose-lowering agents; monitor blood sugar"
  - name: nausea
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Especially with large doses; take with small amount of food at non-mealtime"
  - name: thiamine_competition
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Structural similarity to biotin; theoretical biotin competition at high doses — supplement biotin if using high-dose ALA long-term"

interactions:
  - target: alcar
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
