# Phosphatidylserine — Brain phospholipid; cortisol reduction, memory, ADHD, aging
slug: phosphatidylserine

category: NOOTROPIC
subcategory: phospholipid
legalStatus: LEGAL
description: |
  Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid that is a key structural component of neuronal
  cell membranes, particularly concentrated in the brain. It is involved in cell signaling,
  apoptosis regulation, and neurotransmitter release. The FDA has granted two qualified health
  claims for PS: one for cognitive dysfunction and one for dementia. Human RCTs demonstrate
  cortisol attenuation after acute exercise stress (100mg blunts cortisol ~30%), improved
  memory and processing speed in elderly subjects, and benefits for ADHD symptoms in children.
  Originally derived from bovine brain (highest efficacy but prion risk); modern forms use
  soy or sunflower lecithin.

halfLife: "~12-24 hours; incorporated into membrane for days"
onset: "Cortisol effects acute (single dose); cognitive effects 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Membrane incorporation provides sustained effects with regular dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Structural membrane phospholipid; activates PKC (cell signaling); inhibits cortisol release via HPA axis; supports acetylcholine and dopamine release"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 300
  max: 800
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (2-3 divided doses)"
  notes: "Take with fat-containing meal. 100mg pre-workout blunts cortisol spike. 300mg/day for cognitive benefits. Soy and sunflower PS appear bioequivalent to bovine."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_discomfort
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Occasional insomnia at high doses; generally excellent tolerability"
  - name: insomnia
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "High doses (>600mg) may cause sleep disruption in sensitive individuals"

interactions:
  - target: alpha-gpc
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary cholinergic support: PS supports membrane structure and PKC signaling, alpha-GPC provides choline for ACh synthesis"
  - target: bacopa-monnieri
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both support memory and reduce cortisol; complementary mechanisms — PS works structurally and acutely, bacopa works via AChE inhibition chronically"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: neuronal_membrane_structure
    description: "Concentrated in inner leaflet of neuronal plasma membrane; maintains membrane fluidity and protein function (receptors, ion channels, enzymes)"
  - pathway: PKC_activation
    description: "PS is obligatory cofactor for protein kinase C (PKC) translocation to membrane; PKC mediates learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity"
  - pathway: HPA_attenuation
    description: "PS inhibits ACTH and cortisol release after stress; mechanism involves suppression of hypothalamic CRH neurons"
  - pathway: neurotransmitter_release
    description: "Membrane PS facilitates vesicle fusion for acetylcholine and dopamine exocytosis at synaptic terminals"
