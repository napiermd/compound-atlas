description: |
  Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a fat-soluble quinone compound endogenous to mitochondrial
  inner membranes, serving as an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain
  (complexes I–III) and a lipophilic antioxidant. Endogenous synthesis declines with age
  and is depleted by statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibition blocks the CoQ10 synthesis
  pathway). Clinical evidence supports: reduced blood pressure in hypertension, reduced
  statin-associated myopathy with co-supplementation, and potential benefit in heart
  failure (Q-SYMBIO trial). Ubiquinol form (reduced) has superior bioavailability vs.
  ubiquinone, especially in older adults. Used broadly for cardiovascular health, mitochondrial
  function, anti-aging, and statin myopathy prevention. Safe and well-tolerated.

halfLife: "~33 hours (ubiquinol)"
onset: "Plasma CoQ10 rises within days; clinical effects over 4–12 weeks"
duration: "Requires continued supplementation to maintain elevated levels"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Electron shuttle in mitochondrial ETC (complex I-III); lipophilic antioxidant protecting cell membranes; regenerates vitamins C and E; replenishes statin-depleted CoQ10"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once or twice daily with fat-containing meal"
  notes: "100–200mg/day standard for general use. 300–600mg for heart failure or statin myopathy. Ubiquinol form preferred for those over 40 or with absorption issues. Take with meals — fat-soluble. Divide doses twice daily for higher doses."

    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Stimulatory effects on mitochondrial function may disturb sleep in sensitive individuals; morning dosing preferred"

interactions:
