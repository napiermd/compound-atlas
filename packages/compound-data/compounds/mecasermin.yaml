# Mecasermin — recombinant human IGF-1 (Increlex)
slug: mecasermin
name: Mecasermin

category: PEPTIDE
subcategory: IGF_therapy
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
clinicalPhase: "Approved"
evidenceLevel: B
description: |
  Mecasermin is recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), FDA-approved for
  severe primary IGF-1 deficiency in pediatric patients with growth failure. It bypasses
  growth hormone receptor defects and directly activates IGF-1 signaling. Outside approved
  indications, unsupervised use is high risk due to hypoglycemia and potential proliferative
  signaling concerns.

halfLife: "~6 hours (free); prolonged when bound to IGFBPs"
onset: "Weeks to months for linear growth effects"
duration: "Requires chronic twice-daily administration"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Exogenous IGF-1 replacement activating IGF1R/PI3K-AKT-MAPK signaling to restore growth and anabolic signaling"

dosing:
  min: 0.04
  typical: 0.08
  max: 0.12
  unit: mg/kg
  frequency: "Twice daily with meals/snack"
  notes: "Label-based pediatric titration. Dose should be given shortly before/after food to reduce severe hypoglycemia risk."

safetyCaveats:
  - "Hypoglycemia can be severe; dose with carbohydrate intake and clinical supervision."
  - "Monitor for tonsillar/adenoidal hypertrophy, intracranial hypertension, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children."
  - "Use caution in patients with active or suspected neoplasia due to growth-factor signaling."
legalCaveats:
  - "Prescription biologic with narrow approved indication (severe primary IGF-1 deficiency)."
  - "Non-prescribed performance/anti-aging use may violate local law, sport rules, and medical standards."
