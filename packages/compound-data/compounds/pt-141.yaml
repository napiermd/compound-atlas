description: |
  PT-141 (bremelanotide) is an FDA-approved melanocortin receptor agonist sold as Vyleesi
  for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. Unlike PDE5
  inhibitors, it acts centrally on the hypothalamus rather than on vascular smooth muscle.
  Off-label use by men for erectile dysfunction and libido enhancement is common. It
  produces sexual arousal and desire independent of physical stimulation via MC3R and MC4R
  agonism. Works within 45 minutes; effects last 6–12 hours.
