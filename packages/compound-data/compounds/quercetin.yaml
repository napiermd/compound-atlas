# Quercetin — Flavonoid; senolytic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, AMPK
slug: quercetin

description: |
  Quercetin is a flavonoid polyphenol found in onions, capers, apples, and berries that has
  become central to longevity research as one of the most evidence-backed senolytics —
  compounds that selectively eliminate senescent ("zombie") cells. The Mayo Clinic/Scripps
  dasatinib + quercetin (D+Q) protocol is the gold standard senolytic combination, now in
  multiple human clinical trials. Quercetin also has strong antiviral evidence (zinc ionophore,
  inhibits viral replication), anti-inflammatory properties, cardiovascular protection, and
  AMPK activation. Bioavailability is improved by quercetin phytosome (Quercefit) or EMIQ.

halfLife: "~11-28 hours depending on form"
onset: "Anti-inflammatory effects: days; senolytic protocol: cyclical (see dosing)"
duration: "Ongoing anti-inflammatory/antioxidant; senolytic effects from intermittent protocols"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor (senolytic); AMPK activator; SIRT1 activator; zinc ionophore; NF-kB inhibitor; 5-lipoxygenase and COX inhibitor; mast cell stabilizer"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1000
  max: 2000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily for inflammation; intermittent (3 days on/4 weeks off) for senolytic protocol"
  notes: "Senolytic dosing (D+Q protocol): 1000mg/day × 3 consecutive days, repeat monthly. Daily use for anti-inflammatory/antiviral: 500-1000mg with food. Quercefit phytosome has 20x better bioavailability than standard quercetin. Combine with zinc as ionophore for antiviral protocols."

sideEffects:
