description: |
  L-Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid and the primary substrate for nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) enzymes, making it central to vascular function, blood flow, and erectile
  health. Multiple RCTs confirm blood pressure reduction (pooled effect: -5.4/-2.7 mmHg),
  improved endothelial function, and erectile dysfunction improvement. It also stimulates
  GH secretion (via direct pituitary stimulation) and supports wound healing and immune
  function. Key limitation: oral bioavailability is poor due to extensive first-pass
  intestinal/hepatic arginase catabolism. Citrulline is a better precursor for raising
  plasma arginine levels. At exercise doses, citrulline-malate is superior.

halfLife: "~1-2 hours (plasma)"
onset: "Blood pressure and vascular effects: 1-4 weeks; GH stimulation: acute"
duration: "Short plasma half-life; sustained effects with consistent daily dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Substrate for eNOS, iNOS, nNOS → NO synthesis → cGMP → vasodilation; stimulates pituitary GH release; precursor for ornithine/polyamine synthesis; urea cycle component"

dosing:
  min: 3000
  typical: 6000
  max: 12000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "2-3x/day"
  notes: "Take on empty stomach for GH stimulation effect. For vascular/ED: 3-6g with citrulline is more effective than arginine alone. Pre-workout: citrulline-malate is preferred. Divide doses to avoid GI tolerance."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_discomfort
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most significant limitation: diarrhea and cramping at higher doses (>6g single dose); split dosing and slow titration required"
  - name: herpes_activation
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Arginine may facilitate herpes simplex replication; L-lysine competes with arginine and may offset this risk"

interactions:
  - target: citrulline-malate
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Citrulline converts to arginine in kidneys with much better bioavailability; combining provides both direct arginine and sustained regeneration of plasma arginine — additive NO production"
  - target: tadalafil
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Arginine provides NO substrate, tadalafil prevents cGMP degradation — synergistic vascular and erectile function support via same pathway at different steps"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: nitric_oxide_synthesis
    description: "Primary substrate for all three NOS isoforms (eNOS, nNOS, iNOS); NO production drives soluble guanylate cyclase → cGMP → vascular smooth muscle relaxation"
  - pathway: GH_stimulation
    description: "Intravenous and oral arginine stimulate anterior pituitary GH release via somatostatin suppression; effect is blunted with exercise-induced GH already elevated"
  - pathway: urea_cycle
    description: "Central urea cycle amino acid; converts ammonia to urea in liver; supports nitrogen detoxification during high protein intake"
  - pathway: polyamine_synthesis
    description: "Converted to ornithine (via arginase), then to polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) via ODC; important for cell proliferation and wound healing"
