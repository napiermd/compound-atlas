  Bacopa monnieri is an Ayurvedic herb with the strongest human evidence for long-term memory
  consolidation of any supplement. Multiple meta-analyses (12+ RCTs) confirm improvements in
  free recall, attention, and processing speed. Critically, the mechanism is slow — effects
  require 8-12 weeks of daily use to peak, as bacosides must remodel dendritic branching
  and acetylcholinesterase expression. CDRI-08 (standardized to 55% bacoside A and B) and
  Synapsa are the most validated extracts. Bacopa is notable for being an anxiolytic that
  improves cognition simultaneously — most anxiolytics impair cognition.

halfLife: "~3-4 hours; bacoside tissue effects weeks"
onset: "Initial effects 4 weeks; significant memory improvement 8-12 weeks"
duration: "Effects peak at 12 weeks; persist during supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Bacosides inhibit acetylcholinesterase; induce BDNF and dendrite branching; antioxidant via SOD/CAT induction; serotonin 5-HT3 antagonism; cortisol reduction"

dosing:
  min: 300
  typical: 450
  max: 900
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "Must be taken with fat for absorption of bacosides (fat-soluble saponins). Standardized to 40-55% bacosides. Commit to 8-12 weeks minimum. Take with largest meal."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_upset
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most common — nausea, cramps, diarrhea especially on empty stomach; always take with food containing fat"
  - name: fatigue
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Some users report fatigue, especially initially; generally resolves. Take in morning."
  - name: vivid_dreams
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Increased dream vividness via serotonin modulation; benign, interesting"

interactions:
  - target: lions-mane
    type: synergistic

  - target: ashwagandha
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary Ayurvedic adaptogens: ashwagandha reduces cortisol (acute), bacopa builds memory long-term; together form strong stress-cognition stack"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: acetylcholinesterase_inhibition
    description: "Bacosides inhibit acetylcholinesterase, increasing synaptic acetylcholine availability — similar mechanism to pharmaceutical dementia drugs"
  - pathway: BDNF_induction
    description: "Upregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor and promotes dendritic arborization — structural basis for memory improvement"
  - pathway: antioxidant_enzyme_induction
    description: "Increases superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione levels in brain; reduces lipid peroxidation"
  - pathway: serotonin_modulation
    description: "Modulates serotonergic transmission; 5-HT3 antagonism may contribute to anxiolytic effects and reduced GI symptoms"
  - pathway: cortisol_reduction
    description: "Reduces corticotropin-releasing factor; lower cortisol with continued use contributes to both anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects"
