# S-23 — Most potent SARM; near-steroid anabolic effects, male contraceptive research
slug: s-23

category: SARM
subcategory: arylpropionamide_SARM
legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
description: |
  S-23 is an arylpropionamide SARM developed by GTx Inc. with the highest binding affinity
  to the androgen receptor of any SARM studied. It produces near-steroid-level anabolic
  effects (lean mass, strength, bone density) while being orally bioavailable and potentially
  more selective than traditional anabolic steroids. Originally studied as a male hormonal
  contraceptive — it suppresses LH and FSH enough to suppress spermatogenesis in animal
  models. The trade-off for its potency is the highest suppression of the HPG axis among
  SARMs, approaching or equaling testosterone's suppressive effects. Requires rigorous PCT.
  No human clinical trials published; pharmacology data from animal studies only.

halfLife: "~11-12 hours"
onset: "Anabolic effects 2-4 weeks; full effects 6-8 weeks"
duration: "Effects present during use; recovery requires PCT"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Full agonist at AR in muscle and bone; near-complete LH/FSH suppression via hypothalamic/pituitary AR activation; partial agonist in prostate; no aromatization"

dosing:
  min: 10
  typical: 20
  max: 30
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (split 2x/day)"
  notes: "Advanced users only — closest SARM to traditional steroids in potency and suppression. 10-20mg/day common. Rigorous PCT mandatory. Some users report aggressive mood changes. No human trials — highest uncertainty of any SARM."

sideEffects:
  - name: HPG_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "Most suppressive SARM; approaches testosterone-level suppression; full PCT required; fertility impairment likely during use"
  - name: aggression
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "More mood effects than other SARMs; individual variation"
  - name: lipid_changes
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Significant HDL reduction; cardiovascular monitoring advised"

interactions:
  - target: rad-140
    type: neutral
    severity: severe
    description: "Combining two highly suppressive SARMs multiplies suppression risk; not recommended — use one or the other"
  - target: enclomiphene
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Enclomiphene can maintain LH/FSH during S-23 cycle to reduce suppression depth; requires careful monitoring"

mechanisms:

    description: "Highest AR binding affinity of any studied SARM; full agonist in muscle and bone producing maximal anabolic signaling"
  - pathway: HPG_suppression
    description: "AR activation in hypothalamus and pituitary strongly suppresses GnRH pulsatility and LH/FSH release; spermatogenesis suppression in animal models"
  - pathway: prostate_partial_agonism
    description: "Unlike testosterone, S-23 shows partial agonism in prostate in some models; theoretical reduced prostate hypertrophy risk vs testosterone"
