description: |
  Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, retina, and brain.
  It is conditionally essential — synthesized endogenously but dietary intake meaningfully
  raises tissue levels. Evidence supports cardiovascular protection (reduces blood pressure,
  oxidative stress), endurance performance, electrolyte balance, and mitochondrial function.
  A 2023 Cell paper identified taurine decline as a hallmark of aging and showed
  supplementation extended lifespan in mice and improved health markers in primates.

halfLife: "~1.5 hours (plasma); tissue half-life days to weeks"
onset: "Acute hemodynamic effects within 1-2 hours; performance effects 1-2 weeks"
