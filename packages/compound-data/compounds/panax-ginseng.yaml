  Panax ginseng is one of the most studied herbal adaptogens, used in Traditional Chinese
  Medicine for millennia. Active constituents are ginsenosides (>40 identified), which have
  steroid-like structures and modulate a wide range of pathways. Clinical evidence supports
  cognitive performance (working memory, attention, mental fatigue), immune modulation,
  blood glucose control, erectile function, and modest testosterone support. Red ginseng
  (steamed/dried root) has higher ginsenoside bioavailability and stronger evidence than
  white ginseng. Distinct from American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and Siberian ginseng
  (Eleutherococcus).

halfLife: "Ginsenosides: ~4-16 hours depending on compound"
onset: "Cognitive effects acute to 1 week; adaptogenic/hormonal effects 4-12 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with regular use; tolerance may develop over months"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Ginsenosides activate glucocorticoid receptors, modulate NO production, inhibit neuroinflammation, enhance ACh signaling, support HPG axis via LH stimulation"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 1000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Standardized extract to 5-8% ginsenosides preferred. Red ginseng > white for most outcomes. Cycle 8 weeks on, 2-4 weeks off to prevent tolerance. Take morning."

sideEffects:
  - name: insomnia
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Stimulatory at higher doses; morning dosing only"
  - name: GI_discomfort
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Nausea, diarrhea at high doses; take with food"
  - name: hypoglycemia_risk
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Can lower blood glucose; caution with diabetic medications"
  - name: estrogenic_effects
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Some ginsenosides are phytoestrogens; monitor in hormone-sensitive conditions"

interactions:
  - target: ashwagandha
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary adaptogenic profiles; ginseng more stimulating/acute, ashwagandha more sedating/chronic"
  - target: modafinil
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Ginseng supports neurotransmitter availability; modafinil extends wakefulness — combined cognitive enhancement"

    description: "Ginsenosides act as partial agonists/antagonists at glucocorticoid receptors, modulating stress response"
  - pathway: nitric_oxide_synthase
    description: "Rb1 and Rg1 ginsenosides upregulate eNOS, increasing NO production — vasodilatory and neuroprotective"
  - pathway: acetylcholine_enhancement
