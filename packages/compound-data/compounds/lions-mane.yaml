description: |
  Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) is a medicinal mushroom that stimulates Nerve Growth
  Factor (NGF) synthesis through hericenones (fruiting body) and erinacines (mycelium).
  NGF promotes neuronal survival, axon regeneration, and synaptic plasticity. Clinical
  evidence supports benefits for mild cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and
  potentially neurodegeneration. Effects accumulate over weeks. Quality of extract
  (fruiting body vs. mycelium, beta-glucan content) significantly impacts potency.

halfLife: "Not well characterized; benefits accumulate over weeks via NGF upregulation"
onset: "2-4 weeks for cognitive effects; 4-8 weeks for full benefit"
duration: "Effects may persist weeks after cessation via sustained NGF elevation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Hericenones and erinacines stimulate NGF and BDNF synthesis, promoting neuroplasticity, myelination, and neuroprotection"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1000
  max: 3000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (split 2x/day)"
  notes: "Prefer fruiting body extract with >30% beta-glucans. Dual-extract (hot water + ethanol) provides full-spectrum activity. Whole mushroom powder requires significantly higher doses."

sideEffects:

    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Mild stomach upset in some users; take with food to resolve"
  - name: skin_itch
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Rare allergic-type reaction; may indicate mushroom allergy; discontinue if persistent"
