# Alpha-GPC — Cholinergic nootropic
slug: alpha-gpc
name: Alpha-GPC
aliases:
  - L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine
  - choline alfoscerate
  - alpha-glycerophosphocholine
category: NOOTROPIC
subcategory: cholinergic
legalStatus: LEGAL
description: |
  Alpha-GPC is a choline-containing phospholipid that crosses the blood-brain barrier
  efficiently. It serves as a precursor to acetylcholine synthesis and has demonstrated
  cognitive-enhancing properties, particularly in aging populations. It also shows
  acute effects on growth hormone secretion and power output.

halfLife: "4-6 hours"
onset: "30-60 minutes"
duration: "4-6 hours"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Rapidly absorbed choline donor; crosses BBB and upregulates acetylcholine synthesis in cortical neurons"

dosing:
  min: 300
  typical: 600
  max: 1200
  unit: mg
  frequency: daily
  notes: "300-600mg for nootropic effect; 600mg pre-workout for power output"

sideEffects:
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Usually from excess acetylcholine; reduce dose"

    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "From TMAO production; dose-dependent"

interactions:
  - target: racetams
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Provides choline substrate that racetams increase demand for"
