description: |
  NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) precursors — primarily NMN (nicotinamide
  mononucleotide) and NR (nicotinamide riboside) — are orally bioavailable compounds
  that raise intracellular NAD+ levels. NAD+ declines ~50% between age 40–60, implicating
  it in aging-related metabolic dysfunction. NAD+ is the essential cofactor for sirtuins
  (SIRT1–7), PARP enzymes, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Multiple Phase I/II
  human trials confirm oral NMN and NR significantly increase blood NAD+ levels. NR
  (Tru Niagen) has the most published human data. Benefits demonstrated in humans include
  improved muscle function in older adults, improved exercise capacity, and metabolic
  parameters. The longevity narrative is largely extrapolated from animal data showing
  remarkable effects; human trials are younger. Safe and well-tolerated.

halfLife: "NMN: ~2.5 hours. NR: ~2.7 hours for parent; metabolites longer."
onset: "Blood NAD+ elevation within hours; physiologic effects over weeks to months"
duration: "NAD+ elevation requires continued supplementation; returns to baseline within days"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Orally bioavailable NAD+ precursors; NR converts to NMN then NAD+; NMN converts directly to NAD+; elevates NAD+ for sirtuin activation, PARP DNA repair, and mitochondrial biogenesis"

dosing:
  min: 250
  typical: 500
  max: 1000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily oral (morning)"
  notes: "Most Phase II trials used 250–500mg/day NR or NMN. Higher doses (1,000mg) used in some studies. Morning dosing aligns with circadian NAD+ biology. NR and NMN appear roughly equivalent in practice. Sublingual NMN may bypass gut conversion. Combine with resveratrol or apigenin to reduce NMN degradation (inhibit CD38)."

sideEffects:
  - name: flushing
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild flushing reported, particularly with NR; less than niacin. Usually resolves with continued use."
  - name: GI_upset
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild nausea or GI discomfort at higher doses; take with or without food"
  - name: potential_cancer_concern
    severity: unknown
    frequency: unknown
    notes: "Theoretical concern: NAD+ elevation may accelerate proliferation of pre-existing cancer cells. Animal data mixed. No human signal observed. Theoretical risk in active cancer patients."

mechanisms:
  - pathway: NAD_synthesis
    description: "NMN and NR are direct precursors to NAD+; NR is phosphorylated to NMN, which is then adenylated to NAD+ via NMNAT enzymes"

    description: "PARP enzymes consume NAD+ during DNA damage repair; adequate NAD+ levels maintain genomic stability"
  - pathway: mitochondrial_biogenesis
    description: "SIRT1 activation by NAD+ deacetylates and activates PGC-1α; drives mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism"
