  Glycine is the simplest amino acid and the most abundant in the human body by molar weight.
  It is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and brainstem, a key component
  of collagen (33% of collagen residues), a precursor to glutathione, and a co-agonist at
  NMDA receptors. Multiple RCTs confirm 3g before bed improves sleep quality, reduces
  time to sleep onset, and decreases daytime sleepiness. It is also central to the "methyl
  sink" theory of aging and has significant longevity implications in the glycine-NAC (GlyNAC)
  combination.

halfLife: "~0.5-1 hour (plasma)"
onset: "Sleep effects acute (30-60 min pre-bed); metabolic effects weeks"
duration: "Short plasma half-life; tissue incorporation ongoing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Inhibitory glycine receptor agonist; NMDA co-agonist; collagen precursor; glutathione precursor via GCL; reduces core body temperature"

dosing:
  min: 1000
  typical: 3000
  max: 10000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "3g before bed for sleep. Can be mixed in water — mildly sweet taste. GlyNAC protocol uses 1.33g/kg combined with NAC."
