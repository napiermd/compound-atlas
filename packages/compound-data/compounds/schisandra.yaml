  Schisandra chinensis is a traditional Chinese adaptogen known as "wu wei zi" (five-flavor berry)
  for its taste profile spanning all five TCM flavors. Its primary active compounds are
  schisandrins (lignans) and gomisins. Clinical evidence is strongest for liver protection
  (hepatoprotective, CYP enzyme modulation), physical and mental endurance in athletes,
  and adrenal stress response normalization. The adaptogenic effects are more subtle than
  ashwagandha or rhodiola but it offers a unique combination of performance + liver health
  that makes it valuable in any stack using hepatically-metabolized compounds.

halfLife: "~4-6 hours"
onset: "Performance effects 1-2 weeks; liver enzyme normalization 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Schisandrins modulate NF-kB and Nrf2 pathways; induce CYP3A4/CYP2C19; hepatoprotective via antioxidant induction; HPA axis normalization"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1000
  max: 3000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Standardized extract to >9% schisandrins preferred. Take with fat for better absorption of lipophilic lignans. Useful adjunct to any liver-taxing supplement protocol."

sideEffects:

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Heartburn or loose stools; take with food, reduce dose"
  - name: drug_interactions
    severity: moderate
    frequency: moderate
    notes: "Strong CYP3A4 inducer — reduces levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, warfarin, many medications; review all concurrent drugs"

interactions:
  - target: rhodiola-rosea
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild

  - target: nac
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both support hepatic antioxidant defenses; schisandra induces Nrf2 pathway, NAC provides GSH precursor"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: Nrf2_induction
    description: "Schisandrins activate Nrf2 transcription factor, upregulating glutathione peroxidase, SOD, and other antioxidant enzymes"
  - pathway: CYP_enzyme_modulation
    description: "Induces and inhibits various CYP450 enzymes depending on schisandrin type and dose; significant drug interaction potential"
  - pathway: HPA_normalization
    description: "Reduces corticosterone response to stress; normalizes adrenal output without blocking acute stress response"
  - pathway: hepatoprotection
    description: "Lignans reduce hepatic lipid peroxidation, support liver regeneration, and show protective effects against hepatotoxins in clinical trials"
