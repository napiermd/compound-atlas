description: |
  AOD-9604 is a modified fragment of human growth hormone (amino acids 176-191 with added
  tyrosine at N-terminus) that retains the lipolytic (fat-burning) properties of HGH while
  lacking the metabolic and anabolic effects (no IGF-1 elevation, no insulin resistance, no
  glucose dysregulation). Originally developed by Monash University as an anti-obesity drug;
  Phase III clinical trials completed in 2007 showed modest fat loss benefit and exceptional
  safety. The FDA granted it GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status. Currently research
  use only; Phase II/III trials showed ~14% fat mass reduction in obese subjects over 24 weeks
  vs placebo. Popular in gray market as a "clean" fat loss peptide that doesn't affect the
  GH axis.

halfLife: "~30 minutes"
onset: "Fat mobilization effects within 15-30 minutes; body composition changes weeks to months"
duration: "Lipolytic effect lasts 1-2 hours; cumulative with consistent use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous_injection
  - intranasal
mechanismShort: "Beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonism increases lipolysis in adipocytes; mimics GH lipolytic domain without activating somatotropic axis; may inhibit lipogenesis"

dosing:
  min: 250
  typical: 300
  max: 600
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1x/day (morning, fasted)"
  notes: "Inject fasted for maximum lipolytic effect. No food 1-2h before and after injection. No carbohydrate pre-injection (insulin inhibits effect). Common protocol: 300mcg/day × 5 days/week."

sideEffects:
  - name: injection_site_reaction
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild and routine"
  - name: nausea
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Occasional with intranasal route; rare with SC"

interactions:
  - target: cjc-1295
    type: neutral
    severity: mild
    description: "Can combine; AOD-9604 targets fat loss independently of GH axis, CJC-1295 drives anabolic GH effects — distinct but compatible in body recomposition protocols"
  - target: semaglutide
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary fat loss mechanisms: GLP-1 reduces caloric intake and glucagon, AOD-9604 increases fat mobilization — may be additive"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: beta3_adrenergic_agonism
    description: "Activates beta-3 adrenergic receptors on adipocytes, stimulating hormone-sensitive lipase and fat mobilization (lipolysis)"
  - pathway: lipogenesis_inhibition
    description: "Inhibits de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue independent of adrenergic receptor activation"
  - pathway: non_somatotropic
    description: "Specifically does NOT bind IGF-1 receptor or activate somatotropic axis; no glucose regulation effects — safety profile distinct from full HGH"
