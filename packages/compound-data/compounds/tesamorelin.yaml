# Tesamorelin — FDA-approved GHRH analog (Egrifta)
slug: tesamorelin
name: Tesamorelin

category: PEPTIDE
subcategory: GHRH_analog
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
clinicalPhase: "Approved"
description: |
  Tesamorelin is a stabilized synthetic analog of GHRH, FDA-approved as Egrifta for
  HIV-associated lipodystrophy (excess visceral fat). It reduces visceral adipose tissue
  by 15–20% via sustained GH/IGF-1 elevation. Off-label interest for body composition,
  anti-aging, and cognitive function — particularly given data suggesting IGF-1 may
  support hippocampal function. Unlike CJC-1295, it has a defined clinical evidence base
  from placebo-controlled trials.

halfLife: "~26 minutes; effects sustained via continuous GH stimulation"
onset: "4–8 weeks for body composition changes"
duration: "Effects require ongoing dosing; reverse within weeks of discontinuation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Stabilized GHRH analog binding pituitary GHRH receptors; stimulates GH/IGF-1 production, reducing visceral fat via lipolysis"

dosing:
  min: 1
  typical: 2
  max: 2
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily subcutaneous"
  notes: "FDA-approved dose: 2mg/day subcutaneous at bedtime. Inject in abdomen. Do not inject into scar tissue or bruised areas."

sideEffects:
  - name: injection_site_reaction
    severity: mild
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Erythema, pruritus, pain at injection site — most common adverse effect"
  - name: peripheral_edema
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "From fluid retention related to GH elevation; usually mild"
  - name: arthralgias
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Joint aches from elevated GH/IGF-1; dose-dependent"
  - name: carpal_tunnel_syndrome
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "From fluid retention; resolves with dose reduction or discontinuation"
  - name: glucose_intolerance
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "GH is counter-regulatory to insulin; monitor glucose, especially in pre-diabetics"

interactions:
  - target: hgh
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Additive GH/IGF-1 elevation; combined use increases risk of GH excess side effects. Not typically combined."

mechanisms:
  - pathway: GHRH_receptor_agonism
    description: "Binds pituitary GHRH receptors with 7–10x longer half-life than native GHRH due to structural stabilization"
  - pathway: IGF1_elevation
    description: "Sustained GH elevation drives hepatic IGF-1 production, mediating anabolic and lipolytic downstream effects"
  - pathway: visceral_fat_reduction
    description: "Elevated GH activates hormone-sensitive lipase in visceral adipocytes, selectively mobilizing intra-abdominal fat stores"
