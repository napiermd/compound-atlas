description: |
  Boswellia serrata is a tree resin with the most potent natural 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)
  inhibitor identified — AKBA (acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid). 5-LOX inhibition reduces
  leukotriene synthesis, addressing a pro-inflammatory pathway that NSAIDs don't target.
  Multiple RCTs show significant osteoarthritis pain reduction comparable to celecoxib,
  with faster onset (1 week vs 8 weeks for celecoxib in one head-to-head trial). Also
  has evidence for IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis), asthma, and neuroinflammation.
  Aflapin and 5-Loxin are bioavailability-enhanced extracts with better AKBA delivery.

halfLife: "~6-12 hours"
onset: "Acute anti-inflammatory effects 1-2 weeks; joint pain reduction 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "AKBA directly inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), preventing leukotriene B4/C4/D4 synthesis; reduces inflammatory infiltrate without COX inhibition; MMP inhibition in cartilage"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 300
  max: 400
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day with meals"
  notes: "Standardized to minimum 30% AKBA preferred (5-Loxin or Aflapin). Take with fatty meal — boswellic acids are lipophilic. Aflapin (100mg) may be as effective as standard extract (300mg) due to superior bioavailability."
