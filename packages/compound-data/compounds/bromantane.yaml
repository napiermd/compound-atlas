description: |
  Bromantane is a Soviet-era actoprotector drug developed in the late 1980s for military
  use under extreme heat and physical stress conditions. Unlike classical stimulants, it
  works by upregulating the dopamine synthesis enzyme (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase)
  rather than releasing or blocking reuptake of dopamine. This mechanism makes it non-addictive
  and less prone to tolerance. It also has unique immunostimulant properties. WADA banned
  it in 1996 after several positive tests. Russian clinical trials show it reduces fatigue,
  improves physical performance in heat, and reduces anxiety without sedation.
  It has a dedicated following in advanced nootropic communities for its clean energy profile.

halfLife: "~11 hours"
onset: "Acute energy and mood effects within 1-2 hours; performance effects 1-2 weeks"
duration: "Single dose effects ~12-16 hours; tolerance development slow"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Upregulates AADC (dopa decarboxylase) gene expression; increases dopamine and serotonin synthesis capacity; non-releasing, non-reuptake mechanism; heat shock protein induction"

dosing:
  min: 25
  typical: 50
  max: 100
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1x/day (morning)"
  notes: "Start at 25mg. Effects are dose-dependent. Morning use only due to activating effects. Cycle 5 days on/2 off or take breaks after 4-6 weeks to prevent tolerance."

sideEffects:
  - name: insomnia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Strong activating effect; strict morning dosing required"
  - name: anxiety
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "At higher doses; reduce dose"
  - name: WADA_banned
    severity: severe
    frequency: certain
    notes: "BANNED by WADA — tested athletes must not use; all competitive sport is contraindicated"

interactions:
  - target: l-tyrosine
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild

    severity: mild

mechanisms:
  - pathway: AADC_upregulation
    description: "Upregulates aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) gene expression, increasing rate of L-DOPA→dopamine and 5-HTP→serotonin conversion"
  - pathway: heat_shock_protein_induction
    description: "Induces HSP70 expression, increasing cellular stress resistance to heat and physical exertion"
  - pathway: dopamine_synthesis
    description: "Net effect is increased dopamine synthesis capacity without direct release or reuptake inhibition — less addiction liability than traditional stimulants"
  - pathway: immunostimulation
    description: "Activates innate immune function; increases phagocytic activity of macrophages and NK cell activity"
