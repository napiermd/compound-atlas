# Hexarelin — potent GHRP hexapeptide
slug: hexarelin
name: Hexarelin
aliases:
  - examorelin
  - EP-23905
category: GH_SECRETAGOGUE
subcategory: GHRP
legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
clinicalPhase: "Phase II"
evidenceLevel: C
description: |
  Hexarelin is a synthetic ghrelin receptor agonist/GHRP with strong GH-releasing activity.
  It has been explored in cardiometabolic and endocrine research, but is not approved for
  routine therapeutic use. Tolerance (desensitization) with prolonged exposure is a practical
  limitation in many protocols.

halfLife: "~1 hour (peptide), endocrine effects longer"
onset: "Within minutes for GH pulse"
duration: "2–4 hours endocrine pulse window"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "GHS-R1a agonism causing pulsatile GH release with downstream IGF-1 increases"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 400
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1–2x/day, cyclical usage commonly used"
  notes: "Continuous exposure may blunt response due to receptor desensitization."

safetyCaveats:
  - "Can elevate prolactin/cortisol more than highly selective GHRPs in some users."
  - "May worsen insulin sensitivity in susceptible individuals with chronic high exposure."
  - "Data quality is moderate-to-low for long-term enhancement contexts."
legalCaveats:
  - "Generally not approved for routine prescribing in US/EU enhancement contexts."
  - "Likely prohibited in tested sport."
