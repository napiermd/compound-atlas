description: |
  Fish oil provides the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA
  (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Among the most extensively
  studied supplements with multiple meta-analyses and large RCTs. FDA-approved
  prescription omega-3 formulations (Vascepa — pure EPA; Lovaza — EPA+DHA) for severe
  hypertriglyceridemia. The REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated significant cardiovascular
  mortality benefit with high-dose EPA (icosapentaenoic acid, Vascepa) in statin-treated
  patients. DHA is structural component of neuronal membranes; EPA is primarily
  anti-inflammatory. Evidence supports triglyceride reduction, mild blood pressure
  lowering, and anti-inflammatory effects. Widely used for cardiovascular, brain, and
  anti-inflammatory purposes.

halfLife: "EPA: ~2 days; DHA: ~2.5 days tissue turnover"
onset: "Triglyceride reduction: 2–4 weeks. Anti-inflammatory effects: 4–8 weeks."
duration: "Effects require continued supplementation; tissue depletion over weeks after cessation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "EPA and DHA compete with arachidonic acid for COX/LOX enzymes, shifting eicosanoid production toward anti-inflammatory SPMs; DHA incorporates into cell membranes affecting fluidity and receptor function"

dosing:
  min: 1000
  typical: 2000
  max: 4000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once or twice daily with meals (EPA+DHA content, not total fish oil)"
  notes: "Read labels for actual EPA+DHA content — fish oil capsules often contain 30–50% omega-3. Target 2–4g EPA+DHA/day for triglycerides. 1–2g for general cardiovascular/anti-inflammatory benefit. Take with fatty meals for absorption. Enteric-coated reduces fish burp."

sideEffects:
  - name: fishy_aftertaste
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Fish burp common with standard formulations; enteric-coated or refrigerated capsules reduce this"
  - name: GI_upset
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild GI discomfort at higher doses; take with food, split doses"
  - name: bleeding_risk
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Mild platelet inhibition at high doses (>3g/day); caution with anticoagulants. Clinical significance generally low."

mechanisms:
  - pathway: eicosanoid_competition
    description: "EPA and DHA competitively inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism by COX and LOX enzymes; shifts prostaglandin/leukotriene production toward less inflammatory series-3 and series-5 variants"
  - pathway: SPM_production
    description: "Precursors to specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs): resolvins, protectins, and maresins — actively resolve rather than merely suppress inflammation"
  - pathway: triglyceride_reduction
    description: "Reduces hepatic VLDL synthesis; increases beta-oxidation of fatty acids; dramatically reduces very high triglycerides (>500mg/dL)"
  - pathway: membrane_fluidity
    description: "DHA incorporation into neuronal and erythrocyte membranes improves membrane fluidity, ion channel function, and receptor sensitivity"
