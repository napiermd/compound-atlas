description: |
  Spermidine is a naturally occurring polyamine found in all living cells, with highest
  dietary concentrations in wheat germ, aged cheese, mushrooms, and soy products.
  Endogenous spermidine levels decline sharply with age. Its primary mechanism of longevity
  benefit is autophagy induction — the cellular "self-cleaning" process that removes
  damaged proteins and organelles. Human observational data links higher dietary spermidine
  to reduced all-cause mortality. A clinical trial in older adults showed improved cognitive
  performance. Cardiovascular RCTs show blood pressure reduction and improved heart function.
  One of the most compelling longevity compounds based on mechanism + emerging human data.

halfLife: "~30 minutes (plasma); incorporated into polyamine pool"
onset: "Autophagy induction within hours; cognitive and cardiovascular effects weeks to months"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation; polyamine pool maintained"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Inhibits EP300 acetyltransferase → Nrf2 and LC3 deacetylation → autophagy induction; eIF5A hypusination for translation of specific proteins; anti-inflammatory via NF-kB suppression"

dosing:
  min: 1
  typical: 3
  max: 6
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "Wheat germ extract is the most bioavailable dietary source (Primeadine). Start low — gut bacteria shifts can cause temporary bloating. Take with or without food."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_adjustment
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Temporary bloating as gut microbiome adjusts to increased polyamine substrate; resolves 1-2 weeks"

interactions:
  - target: quercetin
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both induce autophagy via different mechanisms; quercetin via AMPK, spermidine via EP300 inhibition — complementary for maximizing cellular autophagy"
  - target: nad-precursors
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Polyamine synthesis requires NAD+ (via SIRT1/PARP modulation); together with NMN/NR they address multiple aging hallmarks simultaneously"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: autophagy_induction
    description: "Inhibits EP300 acetyltransferase, leading to deacetylation of Atg proteins (LC3, Atg7) and Nrf2 — directly activating the autophagy cascade without caloric restriction"
  - pathway: eIF5A_hypusination
    description: "Required substrate for hypusination of eIF5A translation factor; eIF5A(hypusine) translates specific mRNAs critical for mitochondrial function and immune responses"
  - pathway: anti_inflammatory
    description: "Suppresses NF-kB signaling and inflammatory cytokine production; reduces NLRP3 inflammasome activation"
  - pathway: mitochondrial_biogenesis
    description: "Drives mitophagy (selective mitochondrial autophagy) removing damaged mitochondria, then upregulates TFAM for new mitochondrial DNA synthesis"
