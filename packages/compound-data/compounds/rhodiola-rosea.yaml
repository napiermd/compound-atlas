description: |
  Rhodiola rosea is a high-altitude adaptogenic herb with the strongest acute anti-fatigue
  evidence of any adaptogen. Active constituents are rosavins and salidroside. Multiple RCTs
  demonstrate improved cognitive performance under fatigue, reduced burnout symptoms, and
  enhanced physical endurance. Unlike ashwagandha (HPA modulation, chronic), rhodiola has
  acute stimulant-adjacent effects within hours. EMA (European Medicines Agency) has approved
  it for stress-related fatigue. SHR-5 is the most studied standardized extract.

halfLife: "~4-6 hours"
onset: "Acute anti-fatigue effects within 30-60 minutes; adaptogenic effects 2-4 weeks"
duration: "Acute dose 4-6 hours; chronic effects persist during use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Inhibits MAO-A/B (mild); modulates stress kinases (JNK, AMPK); upregulates SDF-1/HSP70 stress proteins; increases serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine availability"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 680
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Take on empty stomach, 30 min before demanding tasks. Morning/early afternoon only — may impair sleep if taken late. Standardized to 3% rosavins + 1% salidroside. Cycle 5 days on/2 off to prevent tolerance."

sideEffects:
  - name: insomnia
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Stimulatory effect; avoid afternoon/evening dosing"
  - name: agitation
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Especially at higher doses; reduce dose or cycle off"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Usually with initial use; resolves with continued use or dose reduction"

interactions:
  - target: ashwagandha
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary mechanisms: rhodiola for acute energy/cognition, ashwagandha for chronic HPA normalization and cortisol reduction; commonly combined"
  - target: l-tyrosine
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Rhodiola increases catecholamine availability; tyrosine ensures precursor pool is not depleted"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: MAO_inhibition
    description: "Salidroside mildly inhibits monoamine oxidase A and B, reducing breakdown of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine"
  - pathway: stress_kinase_modulation
    description: "Activates heat shock proteins (HSP70) and stress-activated protein kinase JNK pathway, increasing cellular stress resistance"
  - pathway: HPA_axis_modulation
    description: "Modulates cortisol release and adrenal response; distinct from ashwagandha — more upstream activation vs. downstream suppression"
  - pathway: AMPK_activation
    description: "Activates AMPK via salidroside, supporting cellular energy sensing and mitochondrial biogenesis"
