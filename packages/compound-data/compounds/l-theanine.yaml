description: |
  L-Theanine is an amino acid found naturally in green and black tea (Camellia sinensis).
  It promotes a state of relaxed alertness — reducing anxiety without causing sedation —
  and is particularly well-studied in combination with caffeine. It increases alpha brain
  wave activity (8-14 Hz), modulates GABA and glutamate systems, and has a strong safety
  profile with minimal side effects. The caffeine+theanine stack (1:2 ratio) is among the
  most replicated cognitive enhancement combinations in the literature.
