# Ephedrine — Sympathomimetic; fat loss, bronchodilation, energy
slug: ephedrine
name: Ephedrine
aliases:
  - ephedrine HCl
  - ephedra alkaloid
  - Ma Huang (plant source)
  - ECA stack (with caffeine and aspirin)
category: FAT_LOSS
subcategory: sympathomimetic
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic alkaloid originally from the Chinese herb Ma Huang
  (Ephedra sinica), FDA-approved for nasal congestion and bronchospasm. It was widely
  used in weight loss supplements until the FDA banned ephedra dietary supplements in 2004
  following cardiovascular adverse events. Pharmaceutical-grade ephedrine HCl remains
  prescription-available. The ECA stack (ephedrine + caffeine + aspirin) was one of the
  most studied fat loss combinations, with multiple RCTs showing 2-3x greater weight loss
  than placebo. Mechanism: releases norepinephrine/epinephrine and acts as alpha/beta
  adrenergic agonist and mild MAOI. Significant side effect and cardiovascular risk profile.

halfLife: "~3-6 hours"
onset: "Thermogenic effects within 30-60 minutes"
duration: "Active effects 4-6 hours; tolerance develops within 1-2 weeks without cycling"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Indirect sympathomimetic (releases NE/E from presynaptic terminals); direct alpha and beta adrenergic agonism; mild MAO inhibition; increases thermogenesis, lipolysis, bronchodilation"

dosing:
  min: 20
  typical: 25
  max: 75
  unit: mg
  frequency: "3x/day (standard ECA cycle)"
  notes: "ECA protocol: 25mg ephedrine + 200mg caffeine + 81mg aspirin, 3x/day. Cycle 2-3 weeks on/1 week off. NEVER exceed 75mg/day total. Avoid if any cardiac history, hypertension, anxiety disorders, or thyroid disease."

sideEffects:
  - name: cardiovascular
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "Tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations — most significant risk; contraindicated in any cardiovascular disease"
  - name: insomnia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Strong CNS stimulant; strict morning/early afternoon dosing"
  - name: anxiety
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Sympathomimetic anxiety and jitteriness common; dose-reduce or avoid if anxiety-prone"
  - name: tolerance
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Rapid receptor desensitization; cycle 2 weeks on/1 week off"

interactions:
  - target: clenbuterol
    type: caution
    severity: severe
    description: "Both are sympathomimetics with cardiovascular risk — combining significantly amplifies cardiac risk (tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension); do not combine"
  - target: t3-liothyronine
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "T3 upregulates beta-adrenergic receptors, preventing ephedrine desensitization; classic synergistic thermogenic combination with significant risk profile"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: catecholamine_release
    description: "Enters presynaptic terminals via monoamine transporters; displaces NE from vesicles into synapse; increases norepinephrine and dopamine availability"
  - pathway: adrenergic_agonism
    description: "Direct alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonism; vasopressor + bronchodilator + thermogenic effects"
