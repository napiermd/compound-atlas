description: |
  SR9009 (Stenabolic) is a synthetic Rev-Erbα/β agonist developed by the Scripps Research
  Institute. Despite being commonly grouped with SARMs, it has no androgenic mechanism —
  Rev-Erb is a circadian clock nuclear receptor that regulates metabolic gene expression.
  Animal data shows dramatic improvements in endurance (50% increase in running capacity),
  fat mass reduction (60% reduction in diet-induced obesity), and glucose metabolism. The
  primary clinical limitation is bioavailability — oral bioavailability is extremely poor
  (~2%), and injectable forms are used in research contexts. SR9011 has better bioavailability.
  No human RCTs exist. The circadian and metabolic effects are genuinely interesting.

halfLife: "~4-5 hours"
onset: "Circadian effects within days; metabolic effects 1-2 weeks"
duration: "Short acting; multiple daily doses needed for sustained Rev-Erb agonism"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "Rev-Erbα/β nuclear receptor agonist; represses BMAL1/CLOCK circadian transcription; upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation genes; suppresses gluconeogenesis"

dosing:
  min: 10
  typical: 20
  max: 40
  unit: mg
  frequency: "3-4x/day (short half-life; pre-workout timing popular)"
  notes: "Oral bioavailability very poor (~2-5%). Injectable SR9009 has much better bioavailability but gray market. Split into 3-4 doses throughout day to maintain Rev-Erb agonism. Take 1-2h before training for performance effect."
