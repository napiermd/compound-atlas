description: |
  Phenylpiracetam is a phenyl-substituted derivative of piracetam developed in Russia in
  the 1980s. The phenyl group addition increases CNS penetration and adds stimulant
  properties not present in piracetam. Used in Russia for asthenic conditions, cognitive
  impairment post-stroke, and as a cold-tolerance adaptogen. WADA-prohibited (stimulant).
  Effects include increased alertness, focus, cold tolerance, psychomotor speed, and
  motivation — described as "clean stimulation" without piracetam's subtle cognitive
  improvements. Tolerance develops rapidly (2–3 days); requires cycling (2–3x/week maximum).
  No rigorous human clinical trials. Sold as unscheduled gray-market nootropic.

halfLife: "3–5 hours"
onset: "30–60 minutes (acute stimulant effects)"
duration: "4–6 hours per dose"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Phenyl-substituted piracetam; enhances dopamine and norepinephrine activity; increases NMDA/AMPA receptor density; stimulant and cognitive-enhancing properties"

dosing:
  min: 50
  typical: 100
  max: 200
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1–2 times per week maximum (tolerance management)"
  notes: "100mg is the most common single dose. Rapid tolerance development demands strict cycling — daily use loses effect within days. Best used for high-demand days. Not for daily use."

sideEffects:
  - name: tolerance
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Extremely rapid tolerance development (2–3 days of consecutive use). Must cycle (2-3x/week maximum). Daily use renders it ineffective within a week."
  - name: insomnia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Stimulant properties interfere with sleep if dosed after noon; avoid afternoon/evening use"
  - name: irritability
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Stimulant-related mood edge; some users report irritability or anxiety at higher doses"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Racetam-class headache (possibly choline-related); choline supplementation may help"
