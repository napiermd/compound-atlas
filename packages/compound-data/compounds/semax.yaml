  - Pro-Gly-Pro
  - Semax nasal spray
category: NOOTROPIC
subcategory: neuropeptide
legalStatus: GRAY_MARKET
description: |
  Semax is a synthetic heptapeptide (Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro) derived from the ACTH
  4-10 sequence, developed by the Russian Institute of Molecular Genetics. It is used clinically
  in Russia and Ukraine for stroke recovery, ADHD, optic nerve damage, and cognitive enhancement.
  It dramatically increases BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex within minutes,
  produces strong anti-anxiety effects, and improves attention and working memory. Administered
  intranasally for rapid CNS delivery bypassing the BBB. One of the most well-regarded
  cognitive peptides in advanced nootropic circles. No FDA approval; gray market in most
  Western countries.

halfLife: "~15-30 minutes (plasma); CNS effects 12-24 hours"
onset: "Acute focus and mood effects within 15-30 minutes of intranasal application"
duration: "Cognitive effects 6-12 hours; neuroplastic effects accumulate with chronic use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intranasal
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "BDNF/CNTF upregulation in hippocampus; D-Asp-HFP sequence binds melanocortin MC4R; modulates dopaminergic and serotonergic systems; anti-inflammatory via IL-6 reduction"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 600
  max: 1800
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1-3x/day"
  notes: "Intranasal: 2-3 drops per nostril per dose (varies by concentration). Common concentrations: 0.1% (1mg/mL). Cycle: 2 weeks on/1 week off. Subcutaneous injection possible for higher bioavailability."
