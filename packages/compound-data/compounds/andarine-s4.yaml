description: |
  Andarine (S4) is an arylpropionamide SARM developed by GTx Inc. for muscle wasting and
  osteoporosis. It has strong androgenic activity in muscle and bone with the unique property
  of producing significant fat loss alongside lean mass preservation — making it popular
  in cutting protocols. The defining and limiting characteristic is partial agonism at
  androgen receptors in the eye (retinal photoreceptors), causing a yellow/golden tint to
  vision and difficulty adjusting between light/dark environments, particularly at night.
  This side effect is dose-dependent and fully reversible. S4 has not proceeded to Phase III
  trials; clinical development was abandoned primarily due to the vision side effect.

halfLife: "~3-4 hours"
onset: "Anabolic effects 2-4 weeks; visual disturbances within first 1-2 weeks"
duration: "Effects and side effects present during use; vision normalizes 4-8 weeks post-cycle"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Full agonist at androgen receptor in muscle/bone; partial agonist at AR in prostate and eye; promotes nitrogen retention, protein synthesis; fat oxidation via beta-AR upregulation"

dosing:
  min: 25
  typical: 50
  max: 75
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (split 2x/day due to half-life)"
  notes: "50mg/day is the standard dose. Split dosing due to short half-life. Cycle 6-8 weeks. Run PCT. Vision side effects are dose-dependent: 25mg has minimal vision effects, 75mg has significant. DO NOT drive at night if experiencing vision changes."

sideEffects:
  - name: visual_disturbances
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Yellow tint to vision; difficulty with dark adaptation; night driving impaired. Fully reversible on discontinuation. Dose-dependent."
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Moderate HPG axis suppression; PCT recommended after cycles > 4 weeks"
  - name: lipid_alterations
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Reduces HDL; monitor lipid panel during cycle"

interactions:
  - target: ostarine
    type: neutral
    severity: moderate
    description: "Often combined for recomposition; ostarine provides anabolic base, S4 adds fat loss and hardening. Stacking increases combined suppression risk."
  - target: rad-140
    type: neutral
    severity: moderate
    description: "Can stack for greater anabolic effect in recomp; increases suppression and side effect risk — advanced users only"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: androgen_receptor_agonism
    description: "Full agonist at AR in muscle and bone; activates AR-dependent gene transcription for protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and bone mineralization"
  - pathway: retinal_AR_partial_agonism
    description: "Partial agonist at AR in retinal photoreceptors; causes differential visual adaptation between scotopic (dark) and photopic (light) vision"
  - pathway: fat_oxidation
    description: "Androgenic AR activation in adipose tissue upregulates hormone-sensitive lipase and beta-oxidation enzymes; promotes fat mobilization in caloric deficit"
