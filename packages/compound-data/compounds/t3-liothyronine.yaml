description: |
  Liothyronine (T3) is the active form of thyroid hormone, 3-4x more potent than T4
  (levothyroxine) and the dominant driver of metabolic rate, thermogenesis, and cellular
  energy expenditure. In athletes and bodybuilders it is used off-label to increase metabolic
  rate for enhanced fat loss, particularly during caloric restriction when endogenous T3
  levels fall. Medical indications include hypothyroidism, myxedema coma, and thyroid cancer
  suppression. The risk is significant: exogenous T3 suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-
  thyroid (HPT) axis, requiring a careful taper to restore endogenous production. Requires
  close medical supervision.

halfLife: "~2.5 days (biological effect days to weeks)"
onset: "Metabolic increase within 1-3 days; peak effects 1-2 weeks"
duration: "HPT axis suppression persists weeks after cessation; requires taper"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "TR-alpha and TR-beta nuclear receptor agonist → increased mitochondrial uncoupling proteins → thermogenesis; upregulates beta-adrenergic receptors; increases Na+/K+-ATPase expression"

dosing:
  min: 25
  typical: 50
  max: 100
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "2-3x/day (short half-life requires split dosing)"
  notes: "Medical hypothyroidism: 25-75mcg/day. Off-label use: start 25mcg/day, increase by 25mcg weekly. MUST taper off (reduce by 25mcg/week) — abrupt cessation causes rebound hypothyroidism. Cycle max 6-8 weeks for performance use."

    notes: "High T3 increases protein catabolism alongside fat loss; must use with adequate protein intake (2g/kg) and potentially anabolics"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: nuclear_thyroid_receptor
    description: "Activates TR-alpha and TR-beta nuclear receptors; TR-DNA complexes drive transcription of metabolic genes (UCP1, 2, 3; Na+/K+-ATPase; beta-adrenergic receptors)"
  - pathway: thermogenesis
    description: "Upregulates uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in mitochondria; increases metabolic rate by uncoupling ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation"
  - pathway: beta_adrenergic_upregulation
    description: "Increases beta-adrenergic receptor expression; sensitizes tissues to catecholamines and beta-agonists like clenbuterol"
  - pathway: HPT_axis_suppression
    description: "Negative feedback on hypothalamus (reduced TRH) and pituitary (reduced TSH); endogenous thyroid production falls with exogenous supplementation"
