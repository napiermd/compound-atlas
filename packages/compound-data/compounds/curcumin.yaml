description: |
  Curcumin is the primary bioactive polyphenol in turmeric (Curcuma longa) with extensive
  preclinical evidence but historically disappointing clinical results due to poor bioavailability
  (~1% of standard curcumin is absorbed). Bioavailability-enhanced forms (BCM-95, Meriva,
  Longvida, theracurmin) overcome this and show strong clinical evidence for: osteoarthritis
  pain reduction (comparable to ibuprofen), reduced systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6, TNF),
  cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment, and depression adjunct therapy. Multiple
  mechanisms converge on NF-kB inhibition. Use standardized, enhanced-bioavailability forms
  exclusively — plain curcumin powder is largely ineffective.

halfLife: "Variable: standard <1 hour; enhanced forms 6-12 hours"
onset: "Joint pain relief 4-8 weeks; inflammatory marker reductions 6-12 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "IKKβ inhibition → NF-kB nuclear translocation block; COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibition; Nrf2 activation; AMPK activation; reduces TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1000
  max: 3000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day with meals"
  notes: "Use enhanced bioavailability form (Meriva, BCM-95, Longvida, Theracurmin). Standard curcumin powder without piperine or phospholipid complex is largely useless. Take with food containing fat. Combine with black pepper/piperine (200mg quercetin, BioPerine) if using standard extract."
