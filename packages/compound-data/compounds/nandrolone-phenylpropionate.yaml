description: |
  Nandrolone Phenylpropionate (NPP) is a short-acting ester of nandrolone
  (19-nortestosterone), a synthetic anabolic steroid with high anabolic-to-androgenic
  ratio (~3:1 vs testosterone). Approved in some countries for anemia, osteoporosis,
  and muscle-wasting diseases. NPP's 4-5 day half-life requires twice-weekly injections
  but clears faster than Deca-Durabolin (decanoate ester). Highly anabolic with lower
  androgenicity and minimal DHT conversion; however, strongly suppressive and notable for
  "Deca dick" (progesterone-mediated libido/erectile dysfunction). Significant collagen
  synthesis increases benefit connective tissue. Schedule III controlled substance.

halfLife: "~4–5 days"
onset: "1–2 weeks for strength; 4–6 weeks for muscle mass changes"
duration: "Suppression persists 3–4 months post-cycle without PCT"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "Highly anabolic 19-nor androgen; partial AR agonist with progestogenic activity; minimal aromatization; high anabolic-to-androgenic ratio via tissue-specific AR binding"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 300
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Twice weekly intramuscular injection"
  notes: "Performance: 200–400mg/week in 2 injections. Always run with testosterone base to mitigate libido suppression. Requires PCT. Schedule III controlled substance."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Strong HPG suppression — must be run with exogenous testosterone base. Post-cycle recovery slow without PCT."
  - name: libido_dysfunction
    severity: severe
    frequency: common
    notes: "'Deca dick' — progesterone receptor activity reduces libido and causes erectile dysfunction, especially without testosterone base. Cabergoline may help."
  - name: progesterone_activity
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "19-nor structure confers progestogenic activity; gynecomastia risk despite low aromatization. AI alone may be insufficient; cabergoline or bromocriptine used."

    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "HDL reduction, LDL elevation; cardiovascular risk"
  - name: acne
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Lower androgenicity than testosterone; acne less common"

interactions:
  - target: testosterone-cypionate
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
