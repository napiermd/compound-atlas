description: |
  Huperzine A is an alkaloid derived from Huperzia serrata (Chinese club moss) and is one
  of the most potent reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors available without
  prescription. It works by the same mechanism as pharmaceutical dementia drugs (donepezil,
  rivastigmine) but with better CNS penetration and additional NMDA receptor antagonism.
  Chinese clinical trials demonstrate significant benefits in Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.
  It is popular as a study aid and nootropic for acute cognitive enhancement. Because AChE
  inhibition provides sustained effects (long half-life of AChE inhibition), Huperzine A
  should be cycled — continuous use leads to cholinergic downregulation.

halfLife: "~10-14 hours (plasma); AChE inhibition persists 24+ hours"
onset: "Acute cognitive effects within 30-60 minutes; therapeutic effects 4-8 weeks"
duration: "AChE inhibition sustained; cycle 4-6 weeks on, 2 weeks off"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (IC50 ~74nM); NMDA antagonist; upregulates NGF; protects against beta-amyloid neurotoxicity"

dosing:
  min: 50
  typical: 100
  max: 200
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "CYCLE — do not use daily long-term. Use 4-6 weeks on, 2 weeks off. 50-100mcg for nootropic use; 200mcg for clinical/Alzheimer's context. Avoid stacking with other AChE inhibitors. Take with food."

sideEffects:
  - name: cholinergic_excess
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Nausea, muscle cramps, bradycardia, excessive sweating — signs of acetylcholine excess; reduce dose or discontinue"
  - name: vivid_dreams
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Increased REM activity; take in morning to minimize sleep disruption"
  - name: bradycardia
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Cholinergic cardiac effect; caution with pre-existing bradycardia or AV block"

interactions:
  - target: alpha-gpc
    type: caution
    severity: moderate
    description: "Both increase synaptic acetylcholine (alpha-GPC via synthesis, HupA via reduced degradation); combining can cause cholinergic excess — use lower doses or stagger"
  - target: bacopa-monnieri
    type: caution
    severity: mild
    description: "Bacopa also inhibits AChE (weaker); additive effect — reduce HupA dose when combining"
