description: |
  Anavar (Oxandrolone) is an oral anabolic steroid with FDA approval for muscle wasting
  (HIV, burns, surgery recovery, alcoholic hepatitis). DHT-derived, therefore no
  aromatization and no estrogen-related side effects. Among the mildest oral anabolics in
  terms of androgenicity. Does not cause significant water retention. Clinical studies
  confirm lean mass preservation and strength in multiple disease states including AIDS
  wasting, Turner syndrome, and burn patients. Hepatotoxic as an oral 17-alpha-alkylated
  compound. Suppresses testosterone. Widely used in women due to lower virilization risk
  vs. other anabolics. Schedule III controlled substance.

halfLife: "9–10 hours"
onset: "2–3 weeks for strength; 4–6 weeks for body composition"
duration: "Suppression recovers in 4–8 weeks post-cycle; shorter at lower doses"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Oral DHT-derived anabolic; binds AR in muscle/bone without aromatization; high anabolic-to-androgenic ratio; FDA-approved for wasting conditions"

dosing:
  min: 10
  typical: 40
  max: 100
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Oral once or twice daily"
  notes: "Clinical: 2.5–20mg/day. Performance men: 40–80mg/day for 6–8 weeks. Women: 5–20mg/day (virilization risk increases above 20mg). Hepatotoxicity risk — avoid alcohol, limit cycle length. Schedule III controlled substance."

sideEffects:
  - name: testosterone_suppression
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Dose and duration-dependent HPG suppression; milder than testosterone/nandrolone at standard doses; PCT recommended for cycles over 4 weeks"
  - name: hepatotoxicity
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "17-alpha-alkylated oral; liver enzyme elevations common. Monitor LFTs. Avoid alcohol. Limit cycle to 6–8 weeks."
  - name: lipid_changes
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Significant HDL reduction even at low doses; one of the most lipid-unfriendly oral steroids by mg. Cardiovascular risk."
  - name: virilization_women
    severity: severe
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Clitoral enlargement, voice deepening, hirsutism in women — risk increases above 20mg/day and with longer cycles. Irreversible if prolonged."
