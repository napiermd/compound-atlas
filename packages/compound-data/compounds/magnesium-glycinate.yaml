description: |
  Magnesium glycinate is magnesium chelated to glycine, offering superior bioavailability
  and GI tolerance compared to cheaper forms (oxide, sulfate, citrate). Magnesium is a
  cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions including ATP synthesis, DNA repair, and protein
  synthesis. An estimated 50-75% of US adults are deficient. Deficiency correlates strongly
  with poor sleep, anxiety, muscle cramps, hypertension, and impaired glucose metabolism.
  Glycinate form is the preferred choice for neurological, sleep, and stress applications.

halfLife: "~24-48 hours (tissue saturation kinetics; not plasma half-life)"
onset: "Acute sleep and muscle relaxation: 30-60 min; chronic stress and cortisol reduction: 4-8 weeks of consistent dosing"
duration: "Continuous with daily use; tissue levels deplete slowly over 1-2 weeks of cessation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "NMDA receptor voltage-dependent block, calcium channel regulation, HPA axis modulation, ATP synthesis cofactor, melatonin precursor support"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 800
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (evening preferred)"
  notes: "Dose as elemental magnesium. Glycinate form is ~14% elemental Mg by weight. Take at bedtime for sleep benefit. Split doses >400mg to optimize absorption."

sideEffects:
  - name: loose_stools
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Much less than oxide or citrate forms; rare at standard doses with glycinate chelate"
  - name: drowsiness
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild sedation at higher doses; advantageous when taken at bedtime for sleep"

interactions:
  - target: ashwagandha
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary HPA axis modulation: both reduce cortisol and improve sleep quality via distinct mechanisms (NMDA block vs. withanolide action)"
  - target: l-theanine
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both promote GABAergic relaxation — magnesium via NMDA antagonism, L-theanine via GABA-A modulation; synergistic for sleep onset and anxiety"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: NMDA_receptor_block
    description: "Magnesium acts as a voltage-dependent blocker of NMDA glutamate receptor channels, reducing CNS excitability and promoting sleep and relaxation"
  - pathway: calcium_channel_regulation
    description: "Competes with calcium at voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing neurotransmitter release, vasoconstriction, and smooth muscle tension"
  - pathway: ATP_cofactor
    description: "Required for ATP synthesis; physiologically active ATP exists as Mg-ATP complex; deficiency impairs mitochondrial energy production"
  - pathway: HPA_axis_modulation
    description: "Regulates CRH, ACTH, and cortisol secretion; deficiency associated with HPA hyperactivity; supplementation attenuates cortisol response to stress"
  - pathway: melatonin_synthesis_support
    description: "Required cofactor for serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis from serotonin"
