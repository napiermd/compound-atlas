description: |
  9-Methyl-β-carboline (9-MBC) is a synthetic beta-carboline compound with documented
  dopaminergic neuroprotective and neurogenic effects in rodent models. Preclinical data
  shows it increases dopaminergic neuron density in the substantia nigra, promotes
  neurogenesis, enhances cognitive performance, and protects against MPTP-induced
  Parkinson's-like neurodegeneration. Popular in experimental nootropic communities for
  mood, motivation, and cognitive enhancement. Zero human clinical data. Unknown safety
  profile in humans. No regulatory status — pure research compound. Long-term effects
  completely unknown. Among the most speculative compounds in the nootropic space.

halfLife: "Unknown in humans"
onset: "Unknown; animal models show acute behavioral effects within hours"
duration: "Unknown"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - sublingual
mechanismShort: "MAO-A/B inhibitor; promotes dopaminergic neuron proliferation and differentiation; neuroprotective in MPTP Parkinson's models; increases BDNF and GDNF expression (preclinical only)"

dosing:
  min: 5
  typical: 15
  max: 25
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once daily or every other day; extreme caution — no human data"
  notes: "All dosing extrapolated from animal studies and community reports. No established human dose. MAO inhibitor properties require avoiding serotonergic drugs. Zero clinical safety data. High uncertainty."

    severity: severe
    frequency: unknown
    notes: "MAO-A inhibitory properties create serotonin syndrome risk with SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tramadol, other serotonergic compounds. Potentially life-threatening."
