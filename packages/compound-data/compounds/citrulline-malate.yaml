description: |
  Citrulline malate combines L-citrulline (an amino acid) with malate (a Krebs cycle
  intermediate) in a 2:1 ratio. L-citrulline raises plasma arginine levels more effectively
  than supplemental arginine itself due to superior GI absorption and bypass of hepatic
  first-pass metabolism. This boosts nitric oxide (NO) production, causing vasodilation,
  improved blood flow, and the characteristic exercise pump. Malate independently supports
  mitochondrial ATP production. Together they reduce fatigue, improve multi-set training
  volume, and accelerate ammonia clearance.

halfLife: "L-citrulline ~60 minutes (plasma); effects on NO persist 2-4 hours"
onset: "45-60 minutes; take pre-workout"
duration: "3-5 hours"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "L-citrulline converts to arginine → NO via NOS → vasodilation; malate fuels Krebs cycle ATP synthesis and accelerates ammonia clearance"

dosing:
  min: 4000
  typical: 8000
  max: 10000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (45-60 min pre-workout)"
  notes: "Standard dose 8g of 2:1 citrulline:malate pre-workout. Pure L-citrulline dose is 3-6g for equivalent effect. Take with 400-500ml water."

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "High doses (>10g) may cause nausea or cramping; take with water; reduce dose if needed"

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild BP reduction via NO; generally favorable but monitor if on antihypertensives"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: arginine_NO_pathway
    description: "L-citrulline is converted to L-arginine in the kidneys and enterocytes; arginine is substrate for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)"
  - pathway: vasodilation
    description: "NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase → cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation → vasodilation → increased muscle blood flow and oxygen delivery"
