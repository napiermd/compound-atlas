description: |
  Testosterone Enanthate is the most widely used long-acting esterified testosterone.
  FDA-approved for male hypogonadism and delayed puberty. The enanthate ester provides
  a 7-10 day half-life, allowing once or twice-weekly injections for stable blood levels.
  Testosterone is the reference anabolic androgenic steroid from which all others are
  compared. It provides dose-dependent increases in lean mass, strength, bone density, red
  blood cell production, and sexual function. At TRT doses (100-200mg/week), side effects
  are minimal with proper monitoring. At supraphysiological doses used in bodybuilding
  contexts, significant cardiovascular and hormonal risks emerge. Requires AI (aromatase
  inhibitor) and PCT management in non-TRT protocols.

halfLife: "~7-10 days (ester cleavage rate)"
onset: "Hormonal changes within 1-2 weeks; anabolic effects peak 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Levels stabilize with consistent weekly dosing; effects persist during protocol"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular_injection
  - subcutaneous_injection
mechanismShort: "Binds androgen receptor; drives muscle protein synthesis via mTOR/PI3K/Akt; inhibits glucocorticoid receptors; erythropoietin stimulation; aromatizes to estradiol"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 500
  unit: mg
  frequency: "weekly or twice weekly"
  notes: "TRT: 100-200mg/week. Performance: 200-500mg/week. Inject into glute, quad, or delt IM, or subcutaneous. Split into 2 injections/week for more stable levels. Monitor hematocrit, PSA, estradiol, lipids every 3-6 months."

sideEffects:
  - name: estrogen_elevation
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Aromatization to estradiol causes water retention, gynecomastia, mood effects; manage with AI (anastrozole, exemestane) at appropriate doses"
  - name: HPG_suppression
    severity: severe
    frequency: certain
    notes: "Complete suppression of endogenous testosterone; fertility requires HCG or FSH supplementation; recovery requires PCT after non-TRT use"
  - name: erythrocytosis
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Elevated hematocrit (>52%) increases thrombosis risk; monitor and donate blood or dose-reduce if needed"
  - name: lipid_changes
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Reduces HDL, may increase LDL; cardiovascular risk monitoring essential"
