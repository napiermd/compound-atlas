clinicalPhase: "Preclinical"
description: |
  YK-11 is a synthetic steroidal compound that acts as both a partial androgen receptor
  agonist and a myostatin inhibitor — making it structurally unique among compounds
  marketed as SARMs (it is more accurately classified as a synthetic steroid with
  SARM-like properties). In vitro data shows suppression of myostatin (MSTN) via Follistatin
  upregulation, potentially removing the primary biological brake on muscle growth.
  Exclusively in vitro evidence; no animal pharmacokinetic or efficacy data. No human data.
  The most speculative compound in common use.

halfLife: "Unknown"
onset: "Unknown; in vitro effects only"
duration: "Unknown"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Partial AR agonist with structural similarity to DHT; upregulates Follistatin to inhibit myostatin, potentially removing the ceiling on muscle hypertrophy"

dosing:
  min: 2
  typical: 5
  max: 10
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once or twice daily oral"
  notes: "All dosing is extrapolated from community self-experimentation. No established dose. Steroidal structure likely requires PCT. Extreme caution: zero in vivo or human safety data."
