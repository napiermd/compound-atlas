# L-Tyrosine — Catecholamine precursor; focus, stress resilience, cognition
slug: l-tyrosine

legalStatus: LEGAL
description: |
  L-Tyrosine is a non-essential aromatic amino acid and the direct precursor to all
  catecholamines (dopamine → norepinephrine → epinephrine) and thyroid hormones (T3/T4).
  Its cognitive benefits are most pronounced under conditions of catecholamine depletion —
  stress, sleep deprivation, cold exposure, high cognitive load, and multitasking. Military
  research has demonstrated improved performance under adverse conditions. N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine
  (NALT) has better solubility but lower conversion efficiency; plain L-tyrosine is preferred
  for most uses.

halfLife: "~3 hours"
onset: "Acute cognitive effects within 45-90 minutes; most pronounced in depleted states"
duration: "3-5 hours"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Catecholamine synthesis precursor (DOPA decarboxylase pathway); thyroid hormone precursor; competes for large neutral amino acid transporter at BBB"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 2000
  max: 4000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "as needed (acute)"
  notes: "Take on empty stomach for best absorption and CNS uptake. Most effective when acutely stressed, sleep-deprived, or cognitively taxed. Not ideal as daily supplement in rested state."

sideEffects:
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Usually with high doses; reduce dose"
  - name: insomnia
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Avoid evening use; catecholamine elevation impairs sleep"
  - name: thyroid_stimulation
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Theoretical concern in hyperthyroidism; monitor if on thyroid medication"

interactions:
  - target: l-theanine
    type: neutral
    severity: mild
    description: "L-theanine blunts excessive sympathetic activation; may moderate tyrosine-driven catecholamine surge — can combine but may reduce peak effect"
  - target: modafinil
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Modafinil increases catecholamine release; tyrosine ensures precursor availability doesn't become rate-limiting"
