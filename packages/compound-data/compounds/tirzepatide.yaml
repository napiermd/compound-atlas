# Tirzepatide — Dual GLP-1/GIP agonist (Mounjaro / Zepbound)
slug: tirzepatide
name: Tirzepatide
aliases:
  - Mounjaro
  - Zepbound
  - LY3298176
  - dual GLP-1 GIP agonist
category: FAT_LOSS
subcategory: dual_GLP1_GIP_agonist
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
clinicalPhase: "Approved"
description: |
  Tirzepatide is a once-weekly injectable dual agonist of GLP-1 and GIP receptors, approved
  as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management. In the SURMOUNT
  trials, tirzepatide 15mg produced ~22.5% average weight loss over 72 weeks — the greatest
  pharmacological weight reduction ever demonstrated in a pivotal trial. GIP agonism adds
  metabolic benefits beyond GLP-1 alone, including adipocyte sensitization and muscle
  preservation. Superior efficacy vs. semaglutide in head-to-head trials (SURPASS-2).

halfLife: "~5 days"
onset: "Appetite suppression within days; full effect over months"
duration: "Ongoing; weight regain begins within weeks of stopping"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist; GIP agonism sensitizes adipocytes and augments incretin effect beyond GLP-1 alone"

dosing:
  min: 2.5
  typical: 10
  max: 15
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once weekly subcutaneous"
  notes: "Titrate: 2.5mg x4 weeks → 5mg → 7.5mg → 10mg → 12.5mg → 15mg. Inject abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Rotate sites weekly."

sideEffects:
  - name: nausea
    severity: moderate
    frequency: very_common
    notes: "Most common; peaks during titration, improves over weeks"
  - name: diarrhea
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "GI motility effects; typically transient"
  - name: vomiting
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Particularly during dose escalation"
  - name: constipation
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Alternate with diarrhea; from motility changes"
  - name: pancreatitis
    severity: severe
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Black box warning; discontinue with severe abdominal pain"
  - name: thyroid_C_cell_tumors
    severity: severe
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Rodent carcinogenicity signal; contraindicated with MTC/MEN2 history"
  - name: muscle_loss
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Lean mass preservation better than with semaglutide but still significant; prioritize resistance training and protein intake"

interactions:
  - target: semaglutide
    type: antagonistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Both are injectable GLP-1 agonists with overlapping mechanisms; not combined. Tirzepatide shows superior weight loss in head-to-head data."

mechanisms:
  - pathway: GLP1_receptor_agonism
    description: "Activates GLP-1 receptors in pancreas, hypothalamus, and gut to suppress appetite, delay gastric emptying, and stimulate insulin secretion"
  - pathway: GIP_receptor_agonism
    description: "Simultaneously activates GIP receptors; GIP agonism sensitizes adipocytes to insulin, modulates glucagon, and may preserve lean mass better than GLP-1 alone"
  - pathway: hypothalamic_satiety
    description: "Dual receptor activation in arcuate and paraventricular nuclei produces greater satiety signal than GLP-1 alone"
  - pathway: incretin_amplification
    description: "Combined GLP-1 and GIP incretin effects produce more robust glucose-dependent insulin secretion"
