  Boron is an essential trace mineral with emerging evidence for testosterone optimization,
  vitamin D activation, and bone health. A landmark study showed 10mg/day boron for 1 week
  increased free testosterone by 29%, reduced sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by 9%,
  and reduced estradiol by 39%. It also dramatically increases the conversion of 25(OH)D to
  active 1,25(OH)2D vitamin D. Most diets provide 1-3mg/day, with deficiency common in areas
  with boron-poor soil. Calcium fructoborate (FruiteX-B) is the best-studied food-form.

halfLife: "~21 hours"
onset: "Hormonal effects within 1 week; bone effects months"
duration: "Ongoing with daily dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Inhibits SHBG production in liver; activates CYP27B1 for vitamin D conversion; modulates sex steroid binding; supports bone calcium retention"

dosing:
  min: 3
  typical: 10
  max: 20
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily"
  notes: "Food-form boron (calcium fructoborate) has better evidence. 10mg is the dose used in most hormonal studies. Take with food. Upper tolerable limit is 20mg/day."
