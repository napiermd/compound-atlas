description: |
  GHRP-6 (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-6) is a synthetic hexapeptide that stimulates
  GH release via ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a) agonism. It was among the first synthetic GH
  secretagogues studied and provides some of the highest GH pulse amplitudes of the GHRP
  class. GHRP-6 is distinctly appetite-stimulating (strong ghrelin effect) — this is a
  meaningful benefit for athletes seeking mass gain but problematic for physique competitors.
  Compared to GHRP-2 and ipamorelin, GHRP-6 stimulates more cortisol/prolactin elevation
  but also drives the strongest GH pulse. Used in research and gray-market performance contexts.

halfLife: "~15-30 minutes"
onset: "GH pulse begins 15-30 minutes post-injection"
duration: "GH pulse lasts 90-120 minutes; effects accumulate with regular use"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous_injection
  - intramuscular_injection
mechanismShort: "Ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a) agonist in pituitary and hypothalamus; amplifies GHRH-driven GH pulse; stimulates appetite via hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neurons"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 200
  max: 300
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "1-3x/day (pre-workout, bedtime)"
  notes: "Inject on empty stomach for best response (insulin blunts GH). Combine with CJC-1295 or sermorelin for synergistic effect. Strong appetite stimulation — plan caloric intake accordingly. No more than 3 injections/day."

sideEffects:
  - name: intense_hunger
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Strongest appetite stimulation in the GHRP class — expect significant hunger within 30 minutes of injection; plan meals accordingly"
  - name: cortisol_elevation
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "More cortisol/prolactin elevation than GHRP-2 or ipamorelin; relevant in cutting/stress contexts"
  - name: water_retention
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "GH-mediated fluid retention; dose-dependent"
  - name: injection_site_reaction
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild and routine; rotate sites"

interactions:
  - target: cjc-1295
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Classic GHRH+GHRP combination: CJC-1295 provides GHRH-axis amplification, GHRP-6 provides ghrelin-axis stimulus — supra-additive GH pulse"
  - target: sermorelin
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Same dual-axis synergy as with CJC-1295; sermorelin provides shorter-acting GHRH stimulus for more physiological pulse pattern"
