# Anastrozole — Aromatase inhibitor; estrogen management, testosterone optimization
slug: anastrozole
name: Anastrozole

category: HORMONAL
subcategory: aromatase_inhibitor
legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Anastrozole is a third-generation non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) FDA-approved
  for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In male performance medicine and TRT, it
  is used to control estradiol elevation from testosterone aromatization. Excessive estrogen
  during TRT or anabolic steroid use causes water retention, gynecomastia, mood instability,
  and sexual dysfunction. However, estrogen is essential for men too — bone density, libido,
  cardiovascular health, and joint function all require adequate estrogen. Anastrozole dosing
  requires careful titration to labs; over-suppression of estrogen ("crashing estrogen") is
  common and causes significant symptoms.

halfLife: "~50 hours"
onset: "Estradiol reduction within 24-48 hours; clinical symptom relief within 1-2 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing aromatase inhibition during use; estrogen recovery 2-3 weeks after stopping"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Reversible competitive inhibitor of aromatase (CYP19A1); blocks conversion of testosterone → estradiol; reduces circulating estrogen by 70-80% in men"

dosing:
  min: 0.25
  typical: 0.5
  max: 1
  unit: mg
  frequency: "every other day to twice weekly"
  notes: "Dose based on estradiol labs, not symptoms alone. Target estradiol: 20-30 pg/mL for most men on TRT. Common error: overdosing. Start with 0.25mg twice weekly and titrate to labs. Sensitive estradiol assay (LC-MS/MS) preferred over immunoassay."

sideEffects:
  - name: low_estrogen_symptoms
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Joint pain, low libido, fatigue, mood depression — all from estrogen over-suppression; reduce dose"
  - name: bone_density_loss
    severity: moderate
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Estrogen required for bone homeostasis in men; long-term AI use without adequate estrogen accelerates osteoporosis"
  - name: lipid_changes
    severity: moderate
    frequency: common
    notes: "Estrogen has cardioprotective effects; AI use may worsen lipid profile"

interactions:
  - target: testosterone-enanthate
    type: synergistic
