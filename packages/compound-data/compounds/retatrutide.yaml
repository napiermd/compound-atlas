# Retatrutide — Triple GLP-1/GIP/Glucagon receptor agonist
slug: retatrutide
name: Retatrutide
aliases:
  - LY3437943
  - triple agonist
  - GLP-1 GIP glucagon agonist
category: FAT_LOSS
subcategory: triple_agonist
legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
clinicalPhase: "Phase III"
description: |
  Retatrutide is an investigational triple agonist of GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors
  developed by Eli Lilly. Phase II data demonstrated 24.2% average weight loss at 24 weeks
  — exceeding any approved therapy. Glucagon agonism adds hepatic fat mobilization and
  energy expenditure beyond dual GLP-1/GIP. Currently in Phase III trials for obesity and
  type 2 diabetes. Not available outside clinical trials; compounded versions circulate in
  gray market. Represents the next frontier of obesity pharmacology.

halfLife: "~6 days (estimated)"
onset: "Weeks for weight loss; appetite suppression within days"
duration: "Ongoing; effects reverse after discontinuation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
mechanismShort: "Triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor agonist; adds hepatic fat mobilization and increased energy expenditure to GLP-1/GIP incretin effects"

dosing:
  min: 1
  typical: 8
  max: 12
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Once weekly subcutaneous (trial doses)"
  notes: "Phase II trial doses ranged from 1–12mg/week with titration. No approved dosing protocol. Not approved for use outside clinical trials."

    description: "Glucagon component drives higher energy expenditure vs. GLP-1 or dual agonists, contributing to superior weight loss"
