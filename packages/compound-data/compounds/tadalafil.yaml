category: HORMONAL

legalStatus: PRESCRIPTION
description: |
  Tadalafil is a PDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitor FDA-approved for erectile
  dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
  Its 36-hour half-life distinguishes it from sildenafil (Viagra, 4-5h) — allowing the
  "weekend pill" or daily low-dose (5mg) dosing strategies. Beyond sexual function,
  daily tadalafil has growing evidence for: improved exercise tolerance, reduced blood
  pressure, anti-inflammatory effects via cGMP pathway, potential neuroprotection, and
  cardiovascular benefits. At 5mg/day it is FDA-approved for both ED and BPH, and is
  widely used off-label as part of longevity and cardiovascular optimization protocols.

halfLife: "~17.5 hours"
onset: "Erectile effects within 1 hour; daily dosing steady-state in 5 days"
duration: "Up to 36 hours per dose; daily dosing maintains continuous effect"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Selective PDE5 inhibitor; prevents cGMP degradation in vascular smooth muscle → eNOS-derived NO maintains vasodilation → sustained vasodilation in penile corpus cavernosum, pulmonary vasculature, prostate"

dosing:
  min: 2.5
  typical: 5
  max: 20
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (5mg) or as needed (10-20mg)"
  notes: "Daily 5mg: for BPH, consistent ED, cardiovascular optimization. As-needed 10-20mg: 1-2 hours before activity. No food restriction (unlike sildenafil). Absolutely contraindicated with nitrates (severe hypotension)."

sideEffects:
  - name: hypotension
    severity: severe
    frequency: certain
    notes: "ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATION with nitrates (nitroglycerin, amyl nitrate, isosorbide) — life-threatening hypotension"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Due to vasodilation; usually resolves with continued use"
  - name: back_pain_myalgia
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Unique to tadalafil vs other PDE5i; PDE11 inhibition in muscle; usually mild and resolves"
  - name: facial_flushing
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Vasodilation effect; mild and transient"

interactions:
  - target: testosterone-enanthate
    type: synergistic
