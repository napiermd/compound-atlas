description: |
  Urolithin A is a gut-derived metabolite produced from ellagitannins (found in pomegranates,
  walnuts, and berries) by specific gut bacteria. Only ~30-40% of the population has the gut
  microbiome capable of producing it in meaningful amounts — most people don't benefit from
  ellagitannin-rich foods. Mitopure (pharmaceutical-grade UA) provides direct supplementation
  bypassing gut bacteria conversion. Human RCTs show improved mitophagy biomarkers, increased
  muscle endurance (39% better grip endurance), reduced inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha),
  and improved mitochondrial gene expression in elderly subjects. One of the most validated
  postbiotics in clinical development.

halfLife: "~6 hours (plasma); tissue incorporation ongoing"
onset: "Mitophagy biomarker changes 4 weeks; muscle function improvements 4-8 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Selective mitophagy induction via PINK1/Parkin pathway; upregulates mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1alpha; reduces IL-6, TNF-alpha, CRP; extends lifespan in C. elegans, rodents"
