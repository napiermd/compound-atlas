# IGF-1 LR3 — long-acting IGF-1 analog (research use)
slug: igf-1-lr3
name: IGF-1 LR3
aliases:
  - Long R3 IGF-1
  - insulin-like growth factor-1 long arginine 3
category: PEPTIDE
subcategory: IGF_analog
legalStatus: RESEARCH_ONLY
clinicalPhase: "No formal trials"
evidenceLevel: D
description: |
  IGF-1 LR3 is a modified long-acting analog of IGF-1 engineered for reduced IGFBP binding
  and prolonged activity relative to native IGF-1. It is widely sold in gray/research channels
  for bodybuilding and experimental use, but lacks robust controlled human safety/efficacy data.

halfLife: "~20–30 hours (reported, context-dependent)"
onset: "Hours for metabolic signaling; weeks for body-composition claims"
duration: "~1 day biological activity window"
routeOfAdmin:
  - subcutaneous
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "IGF1R activation with prolonged exposure due to reduced binding to IGF-binding proteins"

dosing:
  min: 20
  typical: 40
  max: 100
  unit: mcg
  frequency: "Once daily (research protocols vary)"
  notes: "Human dosing is non-standardized and not medically validated for enhancement use."

safetyCaveats:
  - "No high-quality clinical evidence supports routine non-medical use."
  - "Potential hypoglycemia, edema, and theoretical tumor-promoting risk from chronic mitogenic signaling."
  - "Product purity/counterfeit risk is substantial in non-pharmacy supply chains."
legalCaveats:
  - "Typically sold as research material; not approved for therapeutic use in most jurisdictions."
  - "Likely prohibited by anti-doping organizations."
