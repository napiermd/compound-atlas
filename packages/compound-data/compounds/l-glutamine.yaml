description: |
  L-Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in human plasma and muscle. It is
  conditionally essential — endogenous synthesis is adequate at rest but demand exceeds
  production during illness, trauma, heavy exercise, or gut compromise. It is the primary
  fuel source for rapidly dividing intestinal enterocytes and immune cells. Clinical evidence
  supports its role in gut barrier integrity, reducing intestinal permeability, supporting
  immune function post-surgery and during critical illness, and reducing muscle soreness
  after eccentric exercise. Increasingly used for gut healing protocols.

halfLife: "~1 hour (plasma)"
onset: "Gut barrier effects: days; muscle recovery effects: acute to 1 week"
duration: "Systemic levels normalize within hours; tissue effects require consistent dosing"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Primary fuel for enterocytes and lymphocytes; precursor for glutathione; maintains tight junction integrity; nitrogen transporter"

dosing:
  min: 5000
  typical: 10000
  max: 30000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-3x/day"
  notes: "5g post-workout for recovery. 10-20g/day for gut healing protocols. Higher doses (30g) in clinical/surgical settings under supervision."

sideEffects:

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Occasional bloating at higher doses; take with adequate water"

    notes: "Theoretical concern in neurological conditions; generally safe in healthy individuals"

interactions:
  - target: creatine-monohydrate
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Complementary recovery stack; creatine restores ATP, glutamine restores muscle nitrogen balance"
  - target: glycine
