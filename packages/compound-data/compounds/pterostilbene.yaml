description: |
  Pterostilbene is a naturally occurring stilbene structurally similar to resveratrol but
  with two methoxy groups replacing hydroxyls, resulting in dramatically better oral
  bioavailability (80% vs ~1% for resveratrol) and longer half-life. It activates SIRT1
  more potently than resveratrol and has superior CNS penetration. Found in blueberries
  and grapes at low concentrations. Human studies show cognitive improvements in older
  adults, improved blood pressure (-5-8 mmHg), and better glycemic control. The superior
  pharmacokinetics make pterostilbene strictly better than resveratrol for most brain-
  related outcomes. Often combined with resveratrol for complementary SIRT1 activation.

halfLife: "~7 hours (dramatically longer than resveratrol)"
onset: "Cognitive effects 4-8 weeks; metabolic effects 4-12 weeks"
duration: "Ongoing with daily supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "SIRT1 activator (more potent than resveratrol); AMPK activation; superior BBB penetration; NF-kB inhibition; PPARα activation for fat oxidation; BDNF upregulation"

dosing:
  min: 50
  typical: 100
  max: 250
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "100mg/day covers most targets. Combine with resveratrol (250mg) for complementary sirtuin activation. Can be taken with or without food. Lower doses sufficient vs resveratrol due to much better bioavailability."

sideEffects:
  - name: LDL_elevation
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Higher doses may elevate LDL in some individuals; monitor lipids if using >250mg/day"
  - name: anticoagulant_interaction
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "Mild anti-platelet properties; caution with anticoagulants"

interactions:
  - target: resveratrol
