description: |
  Masteron (Drostanolone) is a DHT-derived anabolic steroid originally developed and
  approved for inoperable breast cancer treatment in the 1970s. Available as propionate
  (short-acting, EOD injections) and enanthate (long-acting, twice-weekly). Unique among
  anabolics for its anti-estrogenic properties — drostanolone acts as an aromatase
  inhibitor and directly competes with estrogen at the receptor level. Does not aromatize.
  Produces hard, dense muscle appearance with minimal water retention, making it popular
  pre-competition. Low anabolic potency relative to other steroids. Suppresses
  testosterone. Schedule III controlled substance.

halfLife: "~2–3 days (propionate); ~10 days (enanthate)"
onset: "2–3 weeks"
duration: "Cycle length 8–12 weeks; suppression recovery 4–8 weeks"
routeOfAdmin:
  - intramuscular
mechanismShort: "DHT-derived androgen with intrinsic anti-estrogenic activity; no aromatization; competes with estrogen at receptor level; moderate AR agonist with hardening/drying cosmetic effects"

dosing:
  min: 200
  typical: 400
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "Propionate: EOD IM injection. Enanthate: twice weekly IM."
  notes: "Performance: 300–500mg/week. Typically used as a finisher compound in cutting phases. Requires testosterone base. Schedule III controlled substance."

sideEffects:

    notes: "HPG axis suppression; PCT required. Typically milder than testosterone at equivalent doses."
