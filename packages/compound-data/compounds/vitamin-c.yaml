description: |
  Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential water-soluble antioxidant and enzyme cofactor
  with extensive clinical evidence across multiple domains. It is a mandatory cofactor for
  hydroxylation reactions in collagen synthesis, carnitine biosynthesis, and catecholamine
  production. As an antioxidant it regenerates vitamin E and glutathione. High-quality RCTs
  support reduction of common cold duration (not prevention in general populations, but strong
  prevention in athletes under heavy training), significant reduction of cortisol and
  inflammatory markers post-exercise, and synergistic collagen synthesis when taken with
  collagen peptides. Liposomal formulations achieve near-IV bioavailability.

halfLife: "~2-3 hours (plasma); tissue stores maintain higher levels"
onset: "Immune and acute antioxidant effects within hours; collagen synthesis effects weeks"
duration: "Water-soluble; excreted within 24 hours; daily dosing required"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
  - intravenous
mechanismShort: "Collagen prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase cofactor; reduces ferric to ferrous iron for absorption; recycles oxidized glutathione and vitamin E; supports catecholamine synthesis"

dosing:
  min: 500
  typical: 1000
  max: 3000
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Split doses (500mg 2x/day) improves absorption vs single large dose. Take with collagen peptides for maximal collagen synthesis benefit. Liposomal form for higher bioavailability. Bowel tolerance varies 2-10g+."

sideEffects:
  - name: osmotic_diarrhea
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Dose-dependent; reduce dose to below bowel tolerance. Split dosing or liposomal form mitigates."
  - name: kidney_stones
    severity: moderate
    frequency: rare
    notes: "High doses (>2g/day) may increase oxalate; relevant in individuals with history of calcium oxalate stones"
  - name: GI_irritation
    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Ascorbic acid is acidic; buffered or liposomal form reduces irritation"
