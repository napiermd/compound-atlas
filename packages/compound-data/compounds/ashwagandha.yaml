  Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an Ayurvedic herb and one of the most extensively
  researched adaptogens. It reduces cortisol, modulates the HPA axis, and has demonstrated
  benefits for stress, anxiety, testosterone, muscle recovery, and sleep quality across
  multiple double-blind RCTs. KSM-66 (full-spectrum root extract) and Sensoril (leaf/root
  blend) are the two clinically validated standardized extracts.

halfLife: "~12 hours (withanolides)"
onset: "2-4 weeks for stress and cortisol effects; acute anxiolytic effects within 60-90 min"
duration: "Effects persist with daily use; 2-3 week wash-out to baseline"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "Withanolides modulate HPA axis, reduce cortisol, potentiate GABA-A signaling, and inhibit NF-kB inflammation"

dosing:
  min: 300
  typical: 600
  max: 1200
  unit: mg
  frequency: "daily (split 2x/day)"
  notes: "Use standardized extract (KSM-66 or Sensoril). Take with food to reduce GI upset. Evening dose supports sleep."

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Nausea and loose stools; take with food to resolve"

    severity: mild
    frequency: uncommon
    notes: "Mild sedation at higher doses; move evening dose to bedtime"

    notes: "May increase T3/T4; monitor thyroid function if on thyroid medication"
  - name: hepatotoxicity
    severity: severe
