  Polygala tenuifolia (yuan zhi) is a traditional Chinese medicine herb increasingly studied
  for its potent neurological effects. It is one of the few herbal compounds with direct
  evidence for promoting neurogenesis — generating new neurons — specifically in the hippocampus.
  Active compounds include onjisaponins, tenuifolin, and senegenin. Human studies and
  multiple animal studies show enhanced memory consolidation, reduced anxiety, and strong
  BDNF upregulation. BT-11 (a standardized fraction) significantly improved memory and
  overall cognitive function in a 12-week human RCT. It also potentiates the cognitive
  effects of other nootropics, particularly when stacked with lion's mane.

halfLife: "~4-6 hours"
onset: "Acute anxiolytic effects within hours; cognitive improvements 4-12 weeks"
duration: "Neurogenic effects accumulate with daily use; benefits persist during supplementation"
routeOfAdmin:
  - oral
mechanismShort: "BDNF induction via TrkB receptor; hippocampal neurogenesis promotion; AChE inhibition; sigma-1 receptor modulation; cAMP/CREB pathway activation"

dosing:
  min: 100
  typical: 300
  max: 600
  unit: mg
  frequency: "1-2x/day"
  notes: "Standardized extract preferred (30-50% senegenin or onjisaponins). Take with food — saponins may cause GI discomfort on empty stomach. Stack with lion's mane for synergistic neurogenic effect."

sideEffects:
  - name: GI_upset
    severity: mild
    frequency: common
    notes: "Saponins are gastric irritants; always take with food to minimize nausea"
  - name: headache
    severity: mild
    frequency: rare
    notes: "At higher doses; reduce dose"

interactions:
  - target: lions-mane
    type: synergistic
    severity: moderate
    description: "Potent neurogenic combination: lion's mane drives NGF synthesis, polygala drives BDNF and hippocampal neurogenesis — complementary neurotrophin support"
  - target: bacopa-monnieri
    type: synergistic
    severity: mild
    description: "Both enhance memory via cholinergic mechanisms; bacopa via AChE inhibition, polygala via cholinergic sensitization — additive memory consolidation support"

mechanisms:
  - pathway: BDNF_upregulation
    description: "Tenuifolin and onjisaponins increase BDNF expression in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex via CREB activation; drives neuroplasticity and memory formation"
  - pathway: neurogenesis
    description: "Promotes adult neurogenesis in dentate gyrus of hippocampus; increases neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation"
  - pathway: AChE_inhibition
    description: "Onjisaponins inhibit acetylcholinesterase, increasing synaptic acetylcholine — cholinergic basis for memory enhancement"
  - pathway: sigma1_receptor
    description: "Senegenin acts at sigma-1 receptors; modulates ER stress response and neuronal calcium signaling"
